# Introduction

Citizen science data in eBird [@sullivan2014] enables large-scale analyses and comparisons of bird abundance, helping guide conservation policy [@soib2020]. The reliability of such trends analyses is contingent on birdwatcher and bird behaviour remaining relatively unchanged between years. COVID-19 and the associated restrictions likely affected where, when and how birdwatchers observed birds during the pandemic years [e.g., @hochachka2021]. We explored whether this was true and if so how it has affected the data, so as to enable meaningful interpretation of any patterns in bird abundance seen during the pandemic years. 

# Methods

We compared data quantity and quality between three distinct periods: before (2019--2020), during (2020--21) and after (2021--22) the pandemic. We analysed data quantity based on number of lists and birding time per observer. Data quality was assessed using various metrics: observer site fidelity, birding distance, list length and duration, as well as proportions of group, hotspot and travelling birding instances. Additionally, we analysed temporal distribution of observations as well as spatial spread and coverage, including differences between urban and non-urban areas. 

# Results

- **Data quantity** in terms of number and effort of birders **increased** rather than decreased with the pandemic, and also continued to rise afterward. This hints at the general growth in eBirding in India.  
- Although total birding time remained similar for observers, checklists in general became **shorter** both spatially (distance covered) and temporally (list duration).

- Some expected changes in data quality were present: **group interactions and overall mobility decreased**, coinciding with higher observer site fidelity, less travel and a reluctance in visiting birding hotspots (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1); Table \@ref(tab:table1)). 

```{r table1, out.width="100%"}

table1 <- data.frame(Metrics = 
                       c("Group birding", "Hotspot birding", "Travelling birding", 
                         "Birding distance", "List duration", "List length", 
                         "Observer site fidelity", "Observer birding time"),
                     Change = c("-ve", "-ve", "-ve", "-ve", "-ve" ,"-ve", "+ve", NA),
                     Period = c("Y", "Y", "M", "M", "M", "M", "M", NA))

table1 %>% 
  kable(caption = "List of data quality metrics and how they changed duringy the pandemic. The *Period* column indicates the duration for which the change persisted: *Y* for a year, or *M* for the crucial months around March to May.",
        align = "lcc", booktabs = F) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "25%") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "25%")

```

- Despite this, **total spatial coverage did not change** (Figure \@ref(fig:figure3)); observations were, however, slightly biased towards urban landscapes. There was also a **"release" effect**, with observations spreading out from urban areas after the pandemic.  

```{r figure2, fig.asp=0.5, fig.width=12, fig.cap="(A) Proportion of checklists submitted from urban areas. (B) Proportion of 24kmx24km grid cells covered.

- The slight changes in data quality were restricted to the months of **March--May**---which saw the nationwide lockdown in 2020 and the devastating second wave in 2021---returning to "normal" levels in the other months.  
- **State-level idiosyncrasies** perhaps reflect differences in government response, severity of the disease, and possibly general attitudes of the public.  


# Conclusions

- The minor and expected changes in data quality, while present, did not result in any prominent bias that would negatively impact interpretability of patterns in eBird data from the pandemic years.  
- Thus, eBird data from India can continue to be used in large-scale analyses of bird ecology. At the smaller-scale, diligence against artefactual abundance trends is advised.  
- The pandemic is an opportunity to study the relationship between birds and anthropogenic factors. For example, an interesting question to answer would be whether or not bird detectability increased during the pandemic due to lower disturbance.
