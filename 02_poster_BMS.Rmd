# Introduction

Citizen science data in eBird [@sullivan2014] enables large-scale analyses and comparisons of bird abundance, helping guide conservation policy [@soib2020]. The reliability of such trends analyses is contingent on birdwatcher and bird behaviour remaining relatively unchanged between years. COVID-19 and the associated restrictions likely affected where, when and how birdwatchers observed birds during the pandemic years [e.g., @hochachka2021]. We explored whether this was true and if so how the data has been affected, so as to enable meaningful interpretation of any patterns in bird abundance seen during the pandemic years. 

# Methods

We compared data quantity and quality between three distinct periods: before (2019--2020), during (2020--21) and after (2021--22) the pandemic. We analysed data quantity based on number of lists and birding time per observer. Data quality was assessed using various metrics: observer site fidelity, birding distance, list length and duration, as well as proportions of group, hotspot and travelling birding instances. Additionally, we analysed temporal distribution of observations as well as spatial spread and coverage, including differences between urban and non-urban areas. 

# Results

- Birdwatchers across India **did not reduce their birding effort** with the pandemic (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)A,B).  
- Birdwatching was highly **concentrated in urban areas** during the period of national lockdown and a few months following it in 2020 (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)C).

- The peak lockdown period was also associated with **changes in birder behaviour**: people avoided public/interactive birding and instead stuck to local areas (higher site fidelity; Figure \@ref(fig:figure2)).

- While site fidelity returned to pre-COVID levels immediately after the lockdown period, people **avoided birding in groups and in hotspots for the whole year**. In fact, group birding was avoided even in 2021 (Table \@ref(tab:table1)).  

```{r table1, out.width="90%", results='asis'}

table1 <- data.frame(Metrics = 
                       c("Group birding", "Hotspot birding", "Travelling birding", 
                         "Birding distance", "List duration", "List length", 
                         "Observer site fidelity", "Observer birding time"),
                     Change = c("-ve", "-ve", "-ve", "-ve", "-ve" ,"-ve", "+ve", NA),
                     Duration = c("Throughout", "2020", "2020", "Peaks", 
                                  "Peaks", "Peaks", "Peaks", NA))

table1 %>% 
  kable(caption = "List of metrics of birder behaviour and how they changed during the pandemic. The \"Duration\" column indicates whether the change persisted throughout the two pandemic years, only in 2020, or only in the crucial peak lockdown months around March--May.",
        align = "lcc", booktabs = T) %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "5in") %>% 
  column_spec(2, width = "3in") %>% 
  column_spec(3, width = "4in")

```

- In some states, especially those with metro cities, birding on **weekdays and at evening hours** increased during the pandemic (Figure \@ref(fig:figure3)).    
- Many **states showed different, often contradictory patterns**, reflecting differences in government response, severity of the disease, and perhaps general attitudes of the public.

# Conclusions

- There was no negative impact on data quantity and its spatial and temporal coverage at the national level.  
- Major changes in birder behaviour were restricted to 2020, and mostly around the periods of peak lockdown. These short periods should be handled with diligence against artefactual abundance trends.
- Overall, eBird data from India can continue to be used in large-scale analyses of bird ecology, e.g., exploring whether or not bird detectability increased during the pandemic due to lower anthropogenic disturbance.
