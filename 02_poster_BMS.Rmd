# Introduction

Citizen science data in eBird [@sullivan2014] enables long-term bird monitoring and comparisons of bird abundance, helping guide conservation policy [@soib2020]. The reliability of such trends analyses is contingent on birdwatcher and bird behaviour remaining relatively unchanged between years. COVID-19 and the associated restrictions likely affected where, when and how birdwatchers observed birds during the pandemic years [e.g., @hochachka2021]. We explored whether this was true and if so how the data has been affected, so as to enable meaningful interpretation of any patterns in bird abundance seen during the pandemic years. 

# Methods

We compared data quantity and quality between three distinct periods: before (Jan 2019--Feb 2020), during (Mar 2020--Aug 2021) and after (Sep 2021--Mar 2022) the pandemic. "After" refers to the period when strict movement regulations were lifted and positivity rates declined. We analysed birdwatching effort based on how many checklists were uploaded and how much time was spent for the activity. We examined changes in birdwatcher behaviour by contrasting how often they visited the same site (fidelity)[^1], how often they visited public hotspots versus personal locations, and what proportion of checklists were travelling (involved movement) versus stationary (balcony/backyard birding). We assessed when birdwatching took place by comparing birdwatching activity across days of the week and times of the day. Similarly, we examined where birdwatching took place by contrasting how much of total geographical area was covered by birdwatchers' observations, and what proportion of these were from urban areas.  

# Results [^2]

- Despite the pandemic, birdwatchers **increased birding effort** at the national level (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)A).  
- Spatial coverage across the country continued to grow during every subsequent time period despite the pandemic (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)B).

```

- Birdwatching was **concentrated in urban areas only in a few months** during the "peak"[^3] phase in 2020 but returned to pre-COVID levels in 2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:figure1)C).  
- The "peak" period was also associated with **changes in birder behaviour**: people avoided public/interactive birding and instead stuck to local areas (higher site fidelity; Figure \@ref(fig:figure2)).

- While people **avoided birding in groups throughout the two pandemic years**, most other changes in birder behaviour returned to pre-COVID levels by 2021 (Table \@ref(tab:table1)).  
- In some states, especially those with metro cities, birding on **weekdays and at evening hours** increased during the pandemic (Figure \@ref(fig:figure3)).    
- Many **states showed different, often contradictory patterns**, reflecting differences in government response, severity of the disease, and perhaps general attitudes of the public.

# Conclusions

- Data quantity and national coverage continued to increase despite the pandemic, with no clear geographical biases.  
- Major changes in birder behaviour were restricted to 2020, and mostly around the periods of peak lockdowns. These short periods should be handled with diligence against artefactual abundance trends.
- Overall, eBird data from India can continue to be used in large-scale analyses of bird ecology, e.g., exploring whether or not bird detectability increased during the pandemic due to lower anthropogenic disturbance.  

[^1]: Site fidelity is inversely proportional to the number of unique 24km $\times$ 24km grid cells visited by an observer.

[^2]: In Figures \@ref(fig:figure1), \@ref(fig:figure2) and \@ref(fig:figure3), points represent mean values, and error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Shaded areas show periods of major change from pre-COVID levels.

[^3]: "Peak" COVID phase refers to the months of March--May and a few months after, involving strict national lockdowns and regulations.
