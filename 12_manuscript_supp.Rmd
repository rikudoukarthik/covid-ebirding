# Methods

## Statistical validation of data metrics

From exploratory analyses to simple confidence values, propagating errors from state level to national level.

All the metrics with their standard errors were first calculated at the state level, then propagated to the national level (errors propagated following error propagation), in order to highlight the high variability across scales, regions, governments, etc.

## Temporal spread

Calculation of metric

## Spatial spread

Detailed description of the various metrics analysed here, how they were calculated, what they can mean (i.e., not interpretation of results we got, unlike in temporal spread above)

## Overall bird reporting: non-model analyses

Detail on how the metric was calculated (not much)

## Bootstrapping for confidence from GLMMs

From model to final CIs

# Figures

## Number of lists in each year, Number of eBirders in each year

Line graphs, both in one

## list distance, list duration

National and state graphs

## group birding, hotspot, protocol

State-level graphs

## Temporal spread

result presentation (graph) and interpretation (caption)

## Overall bird reporting

All/most non-model results (graphs)

10 and 12 months graphs of overall bird models

# Table: Model summaries of all data metrics

Tables of model summaries for all the metrics
