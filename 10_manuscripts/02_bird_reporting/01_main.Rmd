# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The recent anthropause has had impacts on not just human life but also wildlife. In many cases across North America and Europe, birds seemed to respond to lowered human activity with rapid changes in behaviour (e.g., song, detectability), abundance or even occurrence. The anthropause and associated changes, however, did not always benefit the birds, suggesting that the relationships between birds and human activity are complex and context-dependent. To investigate how birds responded to lowered human activity during the pandemic in India, we explored how bird species reporting on a citizen science platform, eBird, changed during the pandemic. We examined patterns of modelled reporting frequencies for select species across different years. Our analysis revealed no predictable difference between these reporting frequencies in the pandemic years and those in the previous and following years. We also found no clear evidence of bird communities becoming more or less abundant during the pandemic, or of urban bird species being reported more frequently than birds of rural areas where the magnitude of the anthropause was likely to be lower (after accounting for existing differences). Therefore, our study finds no compelling evidence for the popular sentiment of birds "returning" to human-inhabited areas in India during the COVID-19 anthropause. This underscores the importance of appropriate, data-driven, and context-specific analyses, and cautions against making broad global generalisations.

# Introduction

## The anthropause in India

COVID-19 was the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century, and resulted in major widespread disruption in human life [see @bates2020]. This anthropause [@rutz2020] has had several cascading impacts, including on wildlife and the environment. Researchers put in effort towards utilising this unique opportunity (of greatly reduced human activity) to better understand the impact of human activities on wildlife, by studying how wildlife responded to the anthropause [@bates2020].

The government in India, like elsewhere, had taken several steps to minimise the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most severe restrictions and regulations such as curfews, quarantines, and shutting down of non-essential public services and activities, happened to fall in the months of April--May in both 2020 and 2021. A nationwide total lockdown was implemented just before April 2020 [@bbcnews2020] and continued until late May [@banerjea2020] when the first wave started to subside. The second wave in India started to peak in May 2021, with a higher fatality rate than the first wave, provoking numerous statewide lockdowns and regulations in the absence of a nationwide lockdown [@theindianexpress2021]. The other months of the pandemic years saw lower and varying degrees of regulations and preventive measures across space and time.

In the big picture, this could have led to lower overall impact of and adherence to regulations due to India's unique position. For instance, social distancing measures have much lower epidemiological and welfare value in lower-income countries such as India than higher-income countries, because they usually necessitate economic sacrifices [@barnett-howell2021]. Indeed, there was a decline in adherence to social distancing measures that cut across socioeconomic strata [@schaner2022]. For all these reasons, the magnitude of the anthropause itself could have been more muted in India than in other countries, particularly in the West.

Nevertheless, these periods of restricted human activity were accompanied by the strong media narrative of wildlife making a comeback, "[reclaiming] their territory" [@karmakar2020] both in India as well as across the globe [@downtoearth2020; see @grandoni2023]. While this surge of anecdotal accounts was followed by empirical tests in certain countries, such formal analyses have been very limited in India. Moreover, the few existing studies in India that did find pandemic-induced changes were focused on mammals, which are a group of large-ranging animals and showed novel ranging dynamics that were inconsistent across species [@behera2022; see also @tucker2023]. As such, there is currently no clear and consistent evidence in India of direct pandemic impacts on bird life, i.e., of birds "making a comeback" to urban areas in India.

## Birds in the anthropause

Our knowledge of bird behavioural traits and abundances changing rapidly during the anthropause---and evidence that the popular "comeback" narrative was not just a result of people paying more attention---is limited to individual (often contradictory) cases from outside India. Birds adjusted song traits in response to lowered anthropogenic noise in San Francisco, USA [@derryberry2020], and in parts of Spain became more detectable in urban areas despite similar occurrence rates [@gordo2021]. In the Pacific Northwest of USA, many bird species responded behaviourally to day-to-day changes in human activity [@sanderfoot2022]. Across North America, during the period of most stringent restrictions, some species showed a decline but most increased in abundance in areas that saw a decrease in human activity [@schrimpf2021].

In contrast, abundances of some species tightly linked to human presence and activity like the Feral Pigeon in Singapore went down [@soh2021]. Reduced human disturbance in urban areas did not necessarily result in increased reproductive output [@seress2021], and in fact even had adverse fitness consequences on some species through increased predation rates [e.g., @hentati-sundberg2021].

Further, the definition of anthropause as the substantial decline in human mobility and activity during COVID-19 lockdowns [@rutz2020] lends itself to the logical conclusion that the anthropause was more pronounced in urban areas where human mobility and activity are highest. Therefore, any impacts of the pandemic should be stronger in urban bird species than species of rural areas where the decline in human activity was likely less substantial. For instance, species that prefer urban habitats could have been reported more regularly during the pandemic than in the years before and after.

India is a large country with diverse landscapes, habitats, and even social and policy environments, in addition to harbouring 12% of the world's bird species---all of which can affect how birds responded to the anthropause and the consequent large-scale patterns of pandemic impacts. Importantly, there is substantial evidence that humans have both positive and negative impacts on wildlife and the environment [@bates2021], and that there are several idiosyncrasies and nuances that need to be taken into consideration before generalising local patterns. Because of the uniqueness of India's response to the pandemic outlined earlier, we can also expect bird responses to the Indian anthropause to have been unique. The question therefore remains about whether or not abundances of Indian birds were impacted by the pandemic, and whether notable changes were consistent across species, space and time.

## Our aim

One way to answer this question is using citizen science (CS) projects like eBird [@sullivan2014]; among its various utilities is the estimation and monitoring of large-scale trends in bird abundance over time, using an index of abundance---calculated for each species as its reporting frequency, taken as a proxy for its true abundance [see e.g., @viswanathanetalSoIB]. Therefore, we wanted to understand whether or not this index of abundance changed predictably during the COVID-19 pandemic for Indian bird species, and how consistently they did so across species, space and time.
