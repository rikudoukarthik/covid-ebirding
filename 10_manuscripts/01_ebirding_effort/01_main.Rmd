# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Conventional systematic projects to monitor bird populations, like breeding bird surveys, require large and coordinated volunteer networks that are lacking in many parts of the world. Semi-structured citizen science (CS) data offers an alternative to systematic initiatives in these regions, but the semi-structured nature of such data also presents several challenges. The utility of semi-structured data to monitor species abundance is contingent on how, where, and how comparably birdwatchers watch birds, year-on-year. Trends inferred directly from the data can be confounded during years when birdwatchers may behave differently, such as during the COVID pandemic. We wanted to ascertain how the data uploaded to one such CS platform in India, eBird, was impacted by the deadliest global pandemic of the 21st century. To understand whether eBird data from the pandemic years in India is useful and comparable to data from adjacent years, we explored several metrics of data quantity and quality (such as birdwatcher behaviour). We also compared patterns of modelled reporting frequencies for select species between the different years, to examine whether they were predictably different from the previous and next years, due to changes in either birdwatcher behaviour or bird abundance. We found no negative impact of the pandemic on data quantity. Data quality changed largely only during the peak months involving lockdowns, probably due to decreased human mobility and social interaction, but remained similar to the adjacent years during the rest of this restrictive period. We did not find a direct impact on large-scale patterns of bird species reporting, despite high variability at finer scales. We also found no clear evidence of shifts in bird abundance due to the pandemic. Our results show that birdwatchers as data collectors are resilient to disturbance, and that the effects of the pandemic on birdwatching and birds are highly context- and scale-dependent. In summary, eBird data in India from the pandemic years remains useful and interpretable for most large-scale applications, but will benefit from preliminary data quality checks when applied to fine-scale questions.

# Introduction

## Birds and citizen science

Citizen science (CS) today is a research technique that engages volunteers from the general public---most of whom are not trained as scientists---in collecting and/or analysing and interpreting data as part of a scientific enquiry [@silvertown2009]. CS programmes have been around for several decades [see @miller-rushing2012] and facilitate attempts at answering large-scale questions that are otherwise not feasible [@macphail2020]. They are particularly effective when they revolve around popular hobbies or activities that people enjoy, such as birdwatching. Birdwatching (hereafter birding) is a nature-based activity that is enjoyed by a large number of people around the world, making CS projects involving birds especially appealing to the public. Birders, as a matter of practice, make "checklists" of the bird species they observe during birding sessions. By volunteering this data, numerous birders---from trained researchers to experienced birders to laypersons---are able to contribute to the scientific study of birds. Many large-scale bird monitoring programmes designed to better understand bird ecology and inform conservation have relied on volunteer birders for data collection [e.g., @greenwood1995; @barrett2003; @sauer2013a; @harris2021; @praveen2022].

Conventional CS bird monitoring programmes that are used to inform conservation are "systematic", in that volunteers follow strict protocols that ensure homogeneity of data in space and time [e.g., @newson2005; @norman2012; @sauer2013a; @birdlifeaustralia2015; @harris2021; @swissornithologicalinstitute2023]. Such programmes are resource- and volunteer-intensive, and not feasible at large scales in many parts of the world. CS programmes therefore vary widely in terms of methodological approach and complexity of data collected [@pocock2017]. In fact, a majority of ecological CS projects are simply a by-product of regular hobbyist nature-watching (e.g., birding) with some specified protocols that make the data "semi-structured" [@pocock2017; @dicecco2021]. eBird [@sullivan2014] is one such CS project that gathers and stores semi-structured data from birders all over the world, enabling large-scale robust scientific analysis and output [@kelling2019].

eBird data has proved very useful in better understanding bird ecology, species ranges [e.g., @freeman2022; @sreekumar2021; @sinnott2021], migration [e.g., @aoki2021; @youngflesh2021], behaviour [e.g., @winger2019; @alaniz2020], morphology [e.g., @vrettos2021; @menon2022] and conservation action [@sullivan2017; @soib2023; @ruiz-gutierrez2021]. A drawback of typical eBird data, however, is that the checklists vary in "effort", quality, and quantity (no single fixed protocol), creating apparent biases in space and time [@johnston2021]. Largely associated with birder behaviour, such biases make the data difficult to use to inform yearly abundance trends, but some recent analyses show that the biases can be reduced statistically to mimic inference from more systematic data [@johnston2021$;$ Viswanathan in press$;$ Viswanathan *et al.* in press$;$ see @soib2023]. Biases in semi-structured data become especially enhanced when there are large-scale changes in human (birder) behaviour, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the widespread utility of semi-structured CS data today for conservation, an important question presents itself: has COVID-19 rendered eBird data from the pandemic years unusable in combination with the rest of the dataset for estimating yearly abundance trends?

## Birding in the time of COVID-19

COVID-19 is a deadly infectious disease that resulted in the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century, with a death toll of more than 6.9 million [around 0.1% of the global population$;$ @wikipedia2023; @worldometer2023]. Governments across the world had therefore taken various precautionary and preventive measures, and had implemented various restrictions such as nation- or state-wide lockdowns and curfews, quarantines and self-isolation, and shutting down of non-essential public services and activities [see @hale2020]. Given that the eBird enterprise hinges entirely on public participation, this widespread public upheaval might have changed the very nature of eBird data during this period.

### How much birding?

The COVID-19 pandemic has generally posed a big challenge for CS programmes [e.g., @kishimoto2021; @hochachka2021]. Social and travel restrictions, in combination with physical and mental distress [@li2020; @vanbavel2020], may have led to a decline in the amount of hobbyist birding, and therefore in the quantity of data generated. While some CS projects did indeed show evidence of reduced participation and data generation [e.g., @kishimoto2021], others in fact witnessed an increase in data generated [e.g., @basile2021]. Outdoor recreational activities such as birding are known to restore attention and play a vital role in improving physical and mental health [@weng2014]. The pandemic brought an increased desire in people to connect with the natural world [@marsh2021], as well as active promotion and encouragement of nature-related activities such as birding [e.g., @birdcountindia2020]. Thus, many turned to birding as their activity of choice [@randler2020].

### What kinds of birding?

Regardless of how much more or less data was generated during the pandemic, the characteristics of this data could also have changed. For example, @randler2020 found differences in aspects of birder behaviour, such as who was birding and with whom, as well as where and when birding (and thus data generation) was happening. Restricted mobility has led to the data being less spread out in space, with observations being concentrated in urbanised locations [@vardi2021] and covering a lower overall diversity of habitats [@hochachka2021], thus reducing its informational value [@zhang2020]. On the other hand, @kishimoto2021 found that the restrictions resulted in lower clustering of data, potentially by forcing birders to upload observations from their erstwhile under-surveyed neighbourhoods and not from birding hotspots (urban or rural).

### Scale and generalisability

@hochachka2021 studied changes in birder behaviour during the month-long lockdown across three countries: USA (states of California and New York), Spain and Portugal. The changes were not as substantial as expected from the magnitude of change to daily life. Moreover, they found differential responses in the respective birding communities to the pandemic, and suggested that such differences are likely to be present amongst spatial units across the world, thus cautioning against a global generalisation of how the pandemic influenced birding and birder behaviour.

***Append to above AV's paragraph on uniqueness of India (including among other things, inappropriateness of assessing habitats from list locations), and why we might expect India to behave differently from what we've seen from other countries in North America, Europe***

Notably, most studies exploring the impacts of the pandemic [e.g., @hochachka2021] have not explored impacts at broader temporal scales of relevance for large-scale analyses of abundance trends, such as for @soib2023. As such assessments have serious implications in informing conservation policy, there is an urgent need to ensure robustness of the data driving them.

## Our aim

In this study, we sought to understand how eBirding effort in India was affected by the pandemic, at multiple scales of space and time. We asked whether or not eBird data quantity and quality (characteristics) were similar before, during and after the pandemic. If not similar, we wanted to ascertain the extent of these changes, by assessing transience (peak pandemic months vs migratory years) and spatial variation (states vs country). Thus, we wished to understand the implications of the pandemic for the utility of eBird data for long-term bird monitoring, specifically for abundance trend estimation.
