  {"id":"alaniz2020","abstract":"Theoretical and empirical studies have addressed predator-prey relationships, but the relevance of individual prey species, prey species richness and environment on the niche and the distribution of specialist predators have been scarcely tested with a macroecological approach. Here we aim to analyze the niche and spatial distribution of the Magellanic woodpecker (MWP; Campephilus magellanicus), a specialist predator, analyzing the relative importance of its individual prey species, prey species richness and environmental factors. We modeled the niches of the MWP and its five most important long-horned beetle prey species, quantifying their similarity in spatial distribution and niche. Then we evaluated the relative importance of single prey species and prey species richness on the potential distribution of the MWP, which showed a high degree of overlap with the niche and spatial distribution of three prey species. MWP models with each of these three prey species had a better fit than the model with prey species richness, and contributed more than environmental variables. These results suggest that MWP responds to particular prey items rather than prey species richness. These findings highlight the usefulness of ecological niche models to identify behavioral traits, being potentially replicable in other types of interactions such as competition, mutualism, parasitism, and pollination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Alaniz","given":"Alberto J."},{"family":"Carvajal","given":"Mario A."},{"family":"Vergara","given":"Pablo M."},{"family":"Fierro","given":"Andrés"},{"family":"Moreira-Arce","given":"Darío"},{"family":"Rojas-Osorio","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Soto","given":"Gerardo E."},{"family":"Rodewald","given":"Amanda D."}],"citation-key":"alaniz2020","container-title":"Global Ecology and Conservation","container-title-short":"Global Ecology and Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01285","ISSN":"2351-9894","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e01285","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Trophic behavior of specialist predators from a macroecological approach: The case of the magellanic woodpecker in south American temperate forests","title-short":"Trophic behavior of specialist predators from a macroecological approach","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235198942030826X","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"anselin1995","abstract":"The capabilities for visualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic information systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the “spatial” aspects of the data. The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Anselin","given":"Luc"}],"citation-key":"anselin1995","container-title":"Geographical Analysis","DOI":"10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x","ISSN":"1538-4632","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"en","page":"93-115","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"aoki2021","abstract":"Long-distance dispersal (LDD) outside a species' breeding range contributes to genetic divergence. Previous phylogeographic studies of migratory bird species have not discriminated LDD from vicariant speciation in their diversification process. We conducted an integrative phylogeographic approach to test the LDD hypothesis, which predicts that a Japanese migratory bird subspecies diverged from a population in the coastal region of the East China Sea (CRECS) via LDD over the East China Sea (ECS). Haplotype networks of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes of its three subspecies were reconstructed to examine whether the Japanese subspecies of the Brown Shrike (Lanius cristatus superciliosus) diverged from an ancestral CRECS population. A species distribution model (SDM) for the Japanese subspecies was constructed using bioclimatic variables under the maximum entropy algorithm. It was projected backwards to the climate of the last glacial maximum (LGM) to infer the candidate source area of colonization. A migratory route of L. c. superciliosus, which possibly reflects a candidate past colonization route, was tracked by light-level geolocators. Molecular phylogenetic networks suggest that the Japanese subspecies diverged from a population in the CRECS and maintained anciently diverged haplotypes. The SDM inferred that the emerged continental shelf of the ECS and the present CRECS were suitable breeding areas for the Japanese subspecies during the LGM. A major migratory route for L. c. superciliosus was inferred between the CRECS and the Japanese archipelago across the ECS. Our integrative approach supported the LDD hypothesis for divergence of the Japanese subspecies of the Brown Shrike. Shrinkage of the ECS may have been responsible for successful population establishment, due to a sufficient number of migrants overshooting to the Japanese archipelago from the CRECS. Our framework provides a new phylogeographic scenario for this region. Discriminating LDD and vicariance models helps improve our understanding of the phylogeographic histories of migratory species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Aoki","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Sakamoto","given":"Haruna"},{"family":"Kitazawa","given":"Munehiro"},{"family":"Kryukov","given":"Alexey P."},{"family":"Takagi","given":"Masaoki"}],"citation-key":"aoki2021","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.7387","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"6066-6079","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Migration-tracking integrated phylogeography supports long-distance dispersal-driven divergence for a migratory bird species in the Japanese archipelago","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.7387","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"basile2021","abstract":"In early 2020, the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led multiple countries to introduce strict lockdown measures to contain the pandemic. Movement restrictions may have influenced the ability of the public to contribute to citizen science projects. We investigated how stay-at-home orders affected data submitted by birdwatchers in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK) to a widely-used citizen science platform, iNaturalist, depending on whether observations were collected in urban or non-urban areas. We found significant trends in the daily number of observations in all three countries, indicating a surge in urban observation during lockdowns. We found an increase in the mean daily number of urban observations during the lockdown in Italy and Spain, compared to previous years. The mean daily number of non-urban observations decreased in Italy and Spain, while remained similar to previous years in the UK. We found a general decrease of new records during the lockdowns both in urban and non-urban areas in all countries. Our results suggest that the citizen science community remained active during the lockdowns and kept reporting birds from home. However, limitations to movements may have hampered the possibility of birdwatchers to explore natural areas and collect new records. Our findings suggest that future research and conservation applications of citizen science data should carefully consider the bias and gaps in data series caused by the pandemic. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of urban areas for nature activities, such as birdwatching, and its relevance for sustainable urban planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Basile","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Luca Francesco"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Valerio Giovanni"},{"family":"Senese","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Bernardo","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"basile2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109079","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109079","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Birds seen and not seen during the COVID-19 pandemic: The impact of lockdown measures on citizen science bird observations","title-short":"Birds seen and not seen during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721001312","volume":"256"},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bates","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Mächler","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Bolker","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Steve"}],"citation-key":"bates2015","container-title":"Journal of Statistical Software","DOI":"10.18637/jss.v067.i01","ISSN":"1548-7660","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2015 Douglas Bates, Martin Mächler, Ben Bolker, Steve Walker","page":"1-48","source":"www.jstatsoft.org","title":"Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v067.i01","volume":"67"},
  {"id":"bates2020","abstract":"Efforts to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) have led to the unprecedented concurrent confinement of nearly two-thirds of the global population. The large human lockdown and its eventual relaxation can be viewed as a Global Human Confinement Experiment. This experiment is a unique opportunity to identify positive and negative effects of human presence and mobility on a range of natural systems, including wildlife, and protected areas, and to study processes regulating biodiversity and ecosystems. We encourage ecologists, environmental scientists, and resource managers to contribute their observations to efforts aiming to build comprehensive global understanding based on multiple data streams, including anecdotal observations, systematic assessments and quantitative monitoring. We argue that the collective power of combining diverse data will transcend the limited value of the individual data sets and produce unexpected insights. We can also consider the confinement experiment as a “stress test” to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in the adequacy of existing networks to detect human impacts on natural systems. Doing so will provide evidence for the value of the conservation strategies that are presently in place, and create future networks, observatories and policies that are more adept in protecting biological diversity across the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bates","given":"Amanda E."},{"family":"Primack","given":"Richard B."},{"family":"Moraga","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Duarte","given":"Carlos M."}],"citation-key":"bates2020","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108665","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108665","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown as a “Global Human Confinement Experiment” to investigate biodiversity conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720307230","volume":"248"},
  {"id":"bates2021","abstract":"The global lockdown to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic health risks has altered human interactions with nature. Here, we report immediate impacts of changes in human activities on wildlife and environmental threats during the early lockdown months of 2020, based on 877 qualitative reports and 332 quantitative assessments from 89 different studies. Hundreds of reports of unusual species observations from around the world suggest that animals quickly responded to the reductions in human presence. However, negative effects of lockdown on conservation also emerged, as confinement resulted in some park officials being unable to perform conservation, restoration and enforcement tasks, resulting in local increases in illegal activities such as hunting. Overall, there is a complex mixture of positive and negative effects of the pandemic lockdown on nature, all of which have the potential to lead to cascading responses which in turn impact wildlife and nature conservation. While the net effect of the lockdown will need to be assessed over years as data becomes available and persistent effects emerge, immediate responses were detected across the world. Thus, initial qualitative and quantitative data arising from this serendipitous global quasi-experimental perturbation highlights the dual role that humans play in threatening and protecting species and ecosystems. Pathways to favorably tilt this delicate balance include reducing impacts and increasing conservation effectiveness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bates","given":"Amanda E."},{"family":"Primack","given":"Richard B."},{"family":"Biggar","given":"Brandy S."},{"family":"Bird","given":"Tomas J."},{"family":"Clinton","given":"Mary E."},{"family":"Command","given":"Rylan J."},{"family":"Richards","given":"Cerren"},{"family":"Shellard","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Geraldi","given":"Nathan R."},{"family":"Vergara","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Acevedo-Charry","given":"Orlando"},{"family":"Colón-Piñeiro","given":"Zuania"},{"family":"Ocampo","given":"David"},{"family":"Ocampo-Peñuela","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Sánchez-Clavijo","given":"Lina M."},{"family":"Adamescu","given":"Cristian M."},{"family":"Cheval","given":"Sorin"},{"family":"Racoviceanu","given":"Tudor"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Kalisa","given":"Egide"},{"family":"Kuuire","given":"Vincent Z."},{"family":"Aditya","given":"Vikram"},{"family":"Anderwald","given":"Pia"},{"family":"Wiesmann","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Wipf","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Badihi","given":"Gal"},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Matthew G."},{"family":"Loetscher","given":"Hanspeter"},{"family":"Baerenfaller","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Benedetti-Cecchi","given":"Lisandro"},{"family":"Bulleri","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Bertocci","given":"Iacopo"},{"family":"Maggi","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Rindi","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Ravaglioli","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Boerder","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Bonnel","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Mathias","given":"Delphine"},{"family":"Archambault","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Chauvaud","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Braun","given":"Camrin D."},{"family":"Thorrold","given":"Simon R."},{"family":"Brownscombe","given":"Jacob W."},{"family":"Midwood","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Boston","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Jill L."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"China","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Roll","given":"Uri"},{"family":"Belmaker","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Zvuloni","given":"Assaf"},{"family":"Coll","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Ortega","given":"Miquel"},{"family":"Connors","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Lacko","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Jayathilake","given":"Dinusha R.

We evaluated the impact of the widespread pandemic-related closures in the spring of 2020 on participation patterns and rates on a national and a state-by-state basis in the United States in four biodiversity-themed community science programs: eBird, eButterfly, iNaturalist, and Nature's Notebook. We compared the number of participants, observations submitted, and proportion of observations collected in urban environments in spring 2020 to the expected values for these metrics based on activity in the previous five years (2015–2019), which in many cases exhibited underlying growth. At the national scale, eButterfly and Nature's Notebook exhibited declines in the number of participants and number of observations submitted during the spring of 2020 and iNaturalist and eBird showed growth in both measures. On a state-by-state basis, the patterns varied geographically and by program. The more popular programs – iNaturalist and eBird – exhibited increases in the Eastern U.S. in both the number of observations and participants and slight declines in the West. Further, there was a widespread increase in observations originating from urban areas, particularly in iNaturalist and eBird. Understanding the impacts of lockdowns on participation patterns in these programs is crucial for proper interpretation of the data. The data generated by these programs are highly valuable for documenting impacts of pandemic-related closures on wildlife and plants and may suggest patterns seen in other community science programs and in other countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Crimmins","given":"Theresa M."},{"family":"Posthumus","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Schaffer","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Prudic","given":"Kathleen L."}],"citation-key":"crimmins2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109017","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109017","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"COVID-19 impacts on participation in large scale biodiversity-themed community science projects in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000690","volume":"256"},

One widely used platform, iNaturalist, provides millions of digitally vouchered observations submitted by a global user base. These observation records include a date and a location but otherwise do not contain any information about the sampling process. As a result, sampling biases must be inferred from the data themselves. In the present article, we examine spatial and temporal biases in iNaturalist observations from the platform's launch in 2008 through the end of 2019. We also characterize user behavior on the platform in terms of individual activity level and taxonomic specialization. We found that, at the level of taxonomic class, the users typically specialized on a particular group, especially plants or insects, and rarely made observations of the same species twice. Biodiversity scientists should consider whether user behavior results in systematic biases in their analyses before using iNaturalist data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Cecco","given":"Grace J"},{"family":"Barve","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Belitz","given":"Michael W"},{"family":"Stucky","given":"Brian J"},{"family":"Guralnick","given":"Robert P"},{"family":"Hurlbert","given":"Allen H"}],"citation-key":"dicecco2021","container-title":"BioScience","container-title-short":"BioScience","DOI":"10.1093/biosci/biab093","ISSN":"0006-3568","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"page":"1179-1188","source":"Silverchair","title":"Observing the Observers: How Participants Contribute Data to iNaturalist and Implications for Biodiversity Science","title-short":"Observing the Observers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biab093","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"dutilleul2000","abstract":"The space-time clustering procedure of Mantel was originally designed to relate a matrix of spatial distance measures and a matrix of temporal distance measures in a generalized regression approach. The procedure, known as the Mantel test in the biological and environmental sciences, includes any analysis relating two distance matrices or, more generally, two proximity matrices. In this paper, we discuss the extent to which a Mantel type of analysis between two proximity matrices agrees with Pearson's correlation analysis when both methods are applicable (i.e., the raw data used to calculate proximities are available). First, we demonstrate that the Mantel test and Pearson's correlation analysis should lead to a similar decision regarding their respective null hypothesis when squared Euclidean distances are used in the Mantel test and the raw bivariate data are normally distributed. Then we use fish and zooplankton biomass data from Lake Erie (North American Great Lakes) to show that Pearson's correlation statistic may be nonsignificant while the Mantel statistic calculated on nonsquared Euclidean distances is significant. After small-size artificial examples, seven bivariate distributional models are tried to simulate data reproducing the difference between analyses, among which three do reproduce it. These results and some extensions are discussed. In conclusion, particular attention must be paid whenever relations established between proximities are backtransposed to raw data, especially when these may display patterns described in the body of this paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Dutilleul","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Jason D."},{"family":"Frigon","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Legendre","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"dutilleul2000","container-title":"Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics","DOI":"10.2307/1400528","ISSN":"1085-7117","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"131-150","publisher":"[International Biometric Society, Springer]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Mantel Test versus Pearson's Correlation Analysis: Assessment of the Differences for Biological and Environmental Studies","title-short":"The Mantel Test versus Pearson's Correlation Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400528","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"fritz2013","abstract":"Spatial cluster analysis is a uniquely interdisciplinary endeavour, and so it is important to communicate and disseminate ideas, innovations, best practices and challenges across practitioners, applied epidemiology researchers and spatial statisticians. In this research we conducted a scoping review to systematically search peer-reviewed journal databases for research that has employed spatial cluster analysis methods on individual-level, address location, or x and y coordinate derived data. To illustrate the thematic issues raised by our results, methods were tested using a dataset where known clusters existed. Point pattern methods, spatial clustering and cluster detection tests, and a locally weighted spatial regression model were most commonly used for individual-level, address location data (n = 29). The spatial scan statistic was the most popular method for address location data (n = 19). Six themes were identified relating to the application of spatial cluster analysis methods and subsequent analyses, which we recommend researchers to consider; exploratory analysis, visualization, spatial resolution, aetiology, scale and spatial weights. It is our intention that researchers seeking direction for using spatial cluster analysis methods, consider the caveats and strengths of each approach, but also explore the numerous other methods available for this type of analysis. Applied spatial epidemiology researchers and practitioners should give special consideration to applying multiple tests to a dataset. Future research should focus on developing frameworks for selecting appropriate methods and the corresponding spatial weighting schemes.","author":[{"family":"Fritz","given":"Charles E."},{"family":"Schuurman","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Lear","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"fritz2013","container-title":"Geospatial Health","container-title-short":"Geospat Health","DOI":"10.4081/gh.2013.79","ISSN":"1970-7096","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"183-198","PMID":"23733283","source":"PubMed","title":"A scoping review of spatial cluster analysis techniques for point-event data","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"gordo2021","abstract":"Biodiversity is threatened by the growth of urban areas. However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities, giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds' response to the population lockdown by using more than 126 000 bird records collected by a citizen science project in northeastern Spain. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human-emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds’ daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities. Therefore, urban birds show high behavioural plasticity to rapidly adjust to novel environmental conditions, such as those imposed by the COVID-19.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gordo","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Brotons","given":"Lluís"},{"family":"Herrando","given":"Sergi"},{"family":"Gargallo","given":"Gabriel"}],"citation-key":"gordo2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2020.2513","issue":"1946","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"page":"20202513","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Rapid behavioural response of urban birds to COVID-19 lockdown","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.2513","volume":"288"},

  {"id":"greenwood1995","abstract":"It is important to monitor bird populations both in their own right and as indicators of the general health of wildlife habitats. The objectives of the British Trust for Ornithology's Integrated Population Monitoring programme relate to breeding bird populations in Britain and Ireland and involve the estimation of demographic parameters as well as assessment of numbers. Current programmes for monitoring bird numbers cover the majority of British species; it would be feasible to monitor most of the rest. A new Breeding Bird Survey has been developed to provide effective coverage of all regions and all major habitats in Britain through random sampling, allowing for the marked geographical variation in volunteer observer density. The final choice of a random sample stratified by observer density (with some professional support in regions with few volunteer observers) was based on comparison with alternative stratifications, using data from a 2-year pilot study to assess the number of species adequately covered under various alternatives. A method of assessing whether or not targets are being achieved at any time has been developed: it involves looking back through the data at intervals of 1-year, 4-year, 16-year and longer spans. It will be possible to refine this by incorporating environmental and density-dependent effects into predictive models. The method is illustrated here using Common Birds Census data. We discuss associated problems of statistical inference and of taking decisions under uncertainty. The data provide evidence for large declines in some species, particularly in farmland; the value of birds as general indicators of habitat health is clear. The results of monitoring can be used to illuminate possible causes of problems and to guide both practical steps to ameliorate the problems and research aimed at better understanding the causes. Examples of such research are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenwood","given":"Jeremy J.

The first of these statements is supported by asymptotic heuristics; the second is supported by simulation experiment results. Mixture random variables that include heteroscedasticity or overdispersion also are explored. In addition, a simple asymptotic variance for the Moran coefficient is presented, assessed, and found to be very precise for sample sizes as small as 25–100. The principal conclusion is that independence and sample size are the most relevant properties for Pitman–Koopmans theorem results to be extended to non-normal random variables.

The absence of tourists in 2020 lead to a sevenfold increase in presence of white-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla, a sevenfold increase in their disturbance of breeding common murres Uria aalge and causing 26% lower murre productivity than the long-term average. Eagles did not prey on murres, but their frequent disturbances delayed egg laying and facilitated egg predation from herring gulls Larus argentatus and hooded crows Corvus cornix.

  {"id":"hochachka2021","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has likely affected natural systems around the world; the curtailment of human activity has also affected the collection of data needed to identify the indirect effects of this pandemic on natural systems. We describe how the outbreak of COVID-19 disease, and associated stay-at-home orders in four political regions, have affected the quantity and quality of data collected by participants in one volunteer-based bird monitoring project, eBird. The four regions were selected both for their early and prolonged periods of mandated changes to human activity, and because of the high densities of observations collected. We compared the months of April 2020 with April in previous years. The most notable change was in the landscapes in which observations were made: in all but one region human-dominated landscapes were proportionally more common in the data in April 2020, and observations made near the rarer wetland habitat were less prevalent. We also found subtler changes in quantity of data collected, as well as in observer effort within observation periods. Finally, we found that these effects of COVID-19 disease varied across the political units, and thus we conclude that any analyses of eBird data will require region-specific examination of whether there have been any changes to the data collection process during the COVID-19 pandemic that would need to be taken into account.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Hany"},{"family":"Gutiérrez-Expósito","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Eliot"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"hochachka2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108974","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108974","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Regional variation in the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quantity and quality of data collected by the project eBird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000264","volume":"254"},

  {"id":"j.praveen2022","abstract":"Citizen-science driven exercises (e.g. bird surveys) and online platforms (e.g. eBird) provide voluminous data on bird occurrence. However, the semi-structured nature of their data collection makes it difficult to compare bird distribution across space and time. Bird atlases are based on standardized surveys and describe the distribution of bird species over a predefined region and have fewer biases, and thus are better suited for use in research. The recently concluded Kerala Bird Atlas (henceforth KBA) is Asia’s largest bird atlas in terms of geographical extent, sampling effort and species coverage. The entire state of Kerala was systematically surveyed twice a year during 2015–20 and over 0.3 million records of 380 species from 25,000 checklists were aggregated. The dataset was filtered and various metrics were estimated. A total of 915 cells were laid out for systematic surveys, of which 888 were surveyed in either or both the seasons – dry season (January–March) and wet season (July–September); 27 cells could not be surveyed in either of the seasons due to logistical constraints. However, this variation in sampling effort had a minimal effect on survey completeness. The slope of the species accumulation curve suggested nearcomplete species sampling in over 70% of the cells. After eliminating nocturnal and pelagic species, data from 361 species were analysed. Species count was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Species richness (count) and evenness were higher in the northern and central districts than in the southern districts. High elevation regions of the southern Western Ghats were the largest contiguous areas lacking sufficient sampling. We found that most of the endemics were concentrated in the Western Ghats, but threatened species were as likely to occur along the coasts as in the Ghats. The KBA dataset is a valuable resource for testing various ecological hypotheses and suggesting science-backed conservation measures. KBA model could be replicated for similar atlases in other states or biogeographic regions of India.","author":[{"literal":"J. Praveen"},{"literal":"P. O.

  {"id":"johnston2021","abstract":"Aim Ecological data collected by the general public are valuable for addressing a wide range of ecological research and conservation planning, and there has been a rapid increase in the scope and volume of data available. However, data from eBird or other large-scale projects with volunteer observers typically present several challenges that can impede robust ecological inferences. These challenges include spatial bias, variation in effort and species reporting bias. Innovation We use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a community science or citizen science (CS) project. We estimate two widely used metrics of species distributions: encounter rate and occupancy probability. For each metric, we critically assess the impact of data processing steps that either degrade or refine the data used in the analyses. CS data density varies widely across the globe, so we also test whether differences in model performance are robust to sample size. Main conclusions Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from CS data; however, the degree of improvement varied with species and data density. The largest gains we observed in model performance were achieved with 1) the use of complete checklists (where observers report all the species they detect and identify, allowing non-detections to be inferred) and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Occupancy models were more robust to a lack of complete checklists. Improvements in model performance with data refinement were more evident with larger sample sizes. In general, we found that the value of each refinement varied by situation and we encourage researchers to assess the benefits in other scenarios. These approaches will enable researchers to more effectively harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within CS data for conservation and basic research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Strimas-Mackey","given":"Matthew E."},{"family":"Ruiz Gutierrez","given":"Viviana"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Orin J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Eliot T."},{"family":"Auer","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Kelling","given":"Steve T."},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"johnston2021","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/ddi.13271","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"1265-1277","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Analytical guidelines to increase the value of community science data: An example using eBird data to estimate species distributions","title-short":"Analytical guidelines to increase the value of community science data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.13271","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"kelling2019","abstract":"Biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate, and monitoring is crucial for understanding the causal drivers and assessing solutions. Most biodiversity monitoring data are collected by volunteers through citizen science projects, and often crucial information is lacking to account for the inevitable biases that observers introduce during data collection. We contend that citizen science projects intended to support biodiversity monitoring must gather information about the observation process as well as species occurrence. We illustrate this using eBird, a global citizen science project that collects information on bird occurrences as well as vital contextual information on the observation process while maintaining broad participation. Our fundamental argument is that regardless of what species are being monitored, when citizen science projects collect a small set of basic information about how participants make their observations, the scientific value of the data collected will be dramatically improved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelling","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Bonn","given":"Aletta"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Ruiz-Gutierrez","given":"Viviana"},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M"},{"family":"Julliard","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Kraemer","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Guralnick","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"kelling2019","container-title":"BioScience","container-title-short":"BioScience","DOI":"10.1093/biosci/biz010","ISSN":"0006-3568","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"page":"170-179","source":"Silverchair","title":"Using Semistructured Surveys to Improve Citizen Science Data for Monitoring Biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biz010","volume":"69"},
  {"id":"kishimoto2021","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way large citizen science events can be carried out—reducing gatherings of large groups and shifting toward individual, small-group, and online participation. This paper aims to describe changes in participant engagement in the City Nature Challenge (CNC) in Tokyo. The CNC is a four-day international event held in April to document biodiversity in cities using an online citizen science platform, iNaturalist. To assess the impact of COVID-19, we compared the number of participants, observations, species, and identification rates in 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (during the pandemic). We also used cluster analysis to elucidate participation patterns, and we assessed changes in the geographical distribution of observation sites. The results showed: (1) the number of participants and observations decreased by 63% and 68%, respectively; however, the number of species was almost the same in the two years, and the identification rate increased 154% in 2020 relative to 2019. (2) The most enthusiastic participants contributed in similar amounts in 2019 and 2020, but participation by less enthusiastic volunteers drastically declined. (3) The spatial distribution of observation sites changed from cluster-like to scattered. Understanding participant engagement during the pandemic could help to improve data quality, reduce geographical bias in observations, maintain records, and recruit more users in future years. Online citizen science could provide opportunities for many citizens to get outside and participate in conservation science during and after the pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kishimoto","given":"Keidai"},{"family":"Kobori","given":"Hiromi"}],"citation-key":"kishimoto2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109001","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109001","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"COVID-19 pandemic drives changes in participation in citizen science project “City Nature Challenge” in Tokyo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000537","volume":"255"},

  {"id":"macgregor2022","abstract":"Research on urban biodiversity has primarily addressed the effects of urbanization and human activity synergistically as it has been virtually impossible to dissociate their impact on city wildlife. However, the anthropause resulting from COVID–19 lockdowns provided an unprecedented scenario to study the relative role of human activity on avian communities. Here we provide evidence of the relationships between human activity and bird species richness in urban areas of Colombia during its strict and subsequent relaxed lockdowns. Once the strict lockdown was lifted and human activity increased, avian species richness decreased by 32 % in 46 % of our sampling sites. Although the strict lockdown lasted only six weeks, local assemblages (mainly from low–intensity urbanization peri–urban sites) swiftly became more diverse. Our findings highlight the importance of taking human activity into account when planning cities, with important focus on greenspaces, if our aim is to conserve and enhance urban biodiversity. Such plans will require not only the cooperation of local governments but also greater awareness among the local population regarding the importance of creating livable, healthy, biodiverse, and resilient cities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"MacGregor","given":"I."},{"family":"Arbeláez–Cortés","given":"E."},{"family":"Estela","given":"F.

We leverage an increase in balcony birdwatching, a million eBird entries, and difference-in-difference techniques to test if urban avian species richness rose during India's COVID-19 lockdown. Controlling for effort, birdwatchers in the 20 most populous cities observed a 16% increase in the number of species during lockdown. While human activity stopped overnight, and noise and visual pollution decreased soon after, increased species diversity was observed 1–2 weeks later; evidence that gradual population recovery, not better detection, underlay our results. We find at-risk, and rare, species among those reclaiming cities, implying that reducing human disturbance in urban areas can protect threatened species. Increased species diversity likely derives from a reduction in noise and air pollution associated with the lockdown, implying that urban planners should consider conservation co-benefits of urban policies when designing sustainable cities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Madhok","given":"Raahil"},{"family":"Gulati","given":"Sumeet"}],"citation-key":"madhok2022","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109597","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109597","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ruling the roost: Avian species reclaim urban habitat during India's COVID-19 lockdown","title-short":"Ruling the roost","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320722001501","volume":"271"},

In this study we examine the characteristics and functions of the garden as a refuge during the period of increased garden interest associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of qualitative results about garden experiences from 3,743 survey respondents revealed intertwining garden and emotional geographies. Utilising non-representational and therapeutic landscape theories, we found multifarious and heightened experiences of non-material aspects of gardens; that is, the sensory and emotional aspects. People experienced, for example, a sense of joy, beauty, and reassurance, a greater attunement to the natural world and an increased sense of nature connection than they had at other times: birds felt louder.

  {"id":"mikula2021","abstract":"Actions taken against the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically affected many aspects of human activity, giving us a unique opportunity to study how wildlife responds to the human-induced rapid environmental changes. The wearing of face masks, widely adopted to prevent pathogen transmission, represents a novel element in many parts of the world where wearing a face mask was rare before the COVID-19 outbreak. During September 2020–March 2021, we conducted large-scale multi-species field experiments to evaluate whether face mask-use in public places elicits a behavioural response in birds by comparing their escape and alert responses when approached by a researcher with or without a face mask in four European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Poland) and Israel. We also tested whether these patterns differed between urban and rural sites. We employed Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (with phylogeny and site as random factors) controlling for a suite of covariates and found no association between the face mask-wear and flight initiation distance, alert distance, and fly-away distance, respectively, neither in urban nor in rural birds. However, we found that all three distances were strongly and consistently associated with habitat type and starting distance, with birds showing earlier escape and alert behaviour and longer distances fled when approached in rural than in urban habitats and from longer initial distances. Our results indicate that wearing face masks did not trigger observable changes in antipredator behaviour across the Western Palearctic birds, and our data did not support the role of habituation in explaining this pattern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mikula","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Jokimäki","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki","given":"Marja-Liisa"},{"family":"Markó","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Morelli","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Møller","given":"Anders Pape"},{"family":"Szakony","given":"Sára"},{"family":"Yosef","given":"Reuven"},{"family":"Albrecht","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Tryjanowski","given":"Piotr"}],"citation-key":"mikula2021","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148672","ISSN":"0048-9697","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"148672","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Face mask-wear did not affect large-scale patterns in escape and alertness of urban and rural birds during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972103744X","volume":"793"},

Aims To test the sample sizes necessary to derive regional population figures and to explore the precision, accuracy and bias of the results. Methods As a case study, distance sampling methodology was applied to transect survey data from the ornithological recording area of Cheshire and Wirral (England), which constitutes about 1% of UK land area. We used data from 109 transects, either surveyed through the UK Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) in 2004 or 2005 or from a project in 2005 to monitor farms in the Entry Level Stewardship Scheme (ELS); this is 1 in 23 of the 1-km squares in the region. Results There were sufficient observations to fit robust detection functions and produce regional-scale population estimates for 61 species – half of the 122 regularly breeding species. Population estimates were further derived for another 16 less common species by applying a detection function from a more common surrogate species. However, some of these population estimates are not considered to be accurate, as judged by local knowledge, the species' distribution shown by a recent tetrad-scale atlas, and as a proportion of the national figures calculated from the national BBS data. The most precise estimates are for species that are evenly distributed across the study area, with decreasing precision for those with a more clumped distribution or species occurring in restricted habitats. Conclusion The present study highlights the potential of these methods and national bird monitoring data for deriving population estimates for many species at a smaller regional scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Norman","given":"David"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Robert   J."},{"family":"Newson","given":"Stuart   E."}],"citation-key":"norman2012","container-title":"Bird Study","DOI":"10.1080/00063657.2011.623766","ISSN":"0006-3657","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2,1]]},"page":"10-21","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Producing regional estimates of population size for common and widespread breeding birds from national monitoring data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2011.623766","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"pocock2017","abstract":"Citizen science—the involvement of volunteers in data collection, analysis and interpretation—simultaneously supports research and public engagement with science, and its profile is rapidly rising. Citizen science represents a diverse range of approaches, but until now this diversity has not been quantitatively explored. We conducted a systematic internet search and discovered 509 environmental and ecological citizen science projects. We scored each project for 32 attributes based on publicly obtainable information and used multiple factor analysis to summarise this variation to assess citizen science approaches. We found that projects varied according to their methodological approach from ‘mass participation’ (e.g. easy participation by anyone anywhere) to ‘systematic monitoring’ (e.g. trained volunteers repeatedly sampling at specific locations). They also varied in complexity from approaches that are ‘simple’ to those that are ‘elaborate’ (e.g. provide lots of support to gather rich, detailed datasets). There was a separate cluster of entirely computer-based projects but, in general, we found that the range of citizen science projects in ecology and the environment showed continuous variation and cannot be neatly categorised into distinct types of activity. While the diversity of projects begun in each time period (pre 1990, 1990–99, 2000–09 and 2010–13) has not increased, we found that projects tended to have become increasingly different from each other as time progressed (possibly due to changing opportunities, including technological innovation). Most projects were still active so consequently we found that the overall diversity of active projects (available for participation) increased as time progressed. Overall, understanding the landscape of citizen science in ecology and the environment (and its change over time) is valuable because it informs the comparative evaluation of the ‘success’ of different citizen science approaches. Comparative evaluation provides an evidence-base to inform the future development of citizen science activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pocock","given":"Michael J.

  {"id":"randler2020","abstract":"The new corona virus infection SARS-CoV2 which was later renamed COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting public health. The fear and the constraints imposed to control the pandemic may correspondingly influence leisure activities, such as birding, which is the practice of observing birds based on visual and acoustic cues. Birders are people who carry out birding observations around the globe and contribute to the massive data collection in citizen science projects. Contrasting to earlier COVID-19 studies, which have concentrated on clinical, pathological, and virological topics, this study focused on the behavioral changes of birders. A total of 4484 questionnaire survey responses from 97 countries were received. The questionnaire had an open-ended style. About 85% of respondents reported that COVID-19 has changed their birding behavior. The most significant change in birdwatchers&rsquo; behavior was related to the geographic coverage of birding activities, which became more local. People focused mostly on yard birding. In total, 12% of respondents (n = 542 cases) reported having more time for birding, whereas 8% (n = 356 cases) reported having less time for birding. Social interactions decreased since respondents, especially older people, changed their birding behavior toward birding alone or with their spouse. Women reported more often than men that they changed to birding alone or with their spouse, and women also reported more often about canceled fieldtrips or society meetings. Respondents from higher developed countries reported that they spend currently more time for birding, especially for birding alone or with their spouse, and birding at local hotspots. Our study suggests that long lockdowns with strict regulations may severely impact on leisure activities. In addition, a temporal and spatial shift in birding due to the pandemic may influence data quality in citizen science projects. As nature-based recreation will be directed more toward nearby sites, environmental management resources and actions need to be directed to sites that are located near the users, e.g., in urban and suburban areas. The results can be applied with caution to other nature-based recreational activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Randler","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Tryjanowski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Jokimäki","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki","given":"Marja-Liisa"},{"family":"Staller","given":"Naomi"}],"citation-key":"randler2020","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph17197310","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"19","page":"7310","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) Pandemic Lockdown Influences Nature-Based Recreational Activity: The Case of Birders","title-short":"SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) Pandemic Lockdown Influences Nature-Based Recreational Activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/19/7310","volume":"17"},

COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns presented a unique opportunity to disentangle these effects during a period of reduced human activity. We launched a community science project in spring 2020 to explore drivers of site use by and detection of common birds in cities under lockdown in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Our goals were twofold: (1) consider how intensity of urbanization, canopy cover, and availability of bird feeders and bird baths influenced avian habitat use; and (2) quantify how daily changes in weather, air pollution, and human mobility influenced detection of birds. We analyzed 6,640 surveys from 367 volunteers at 429 monitoring sites using occupancy models for 46 study species. Neither land cover nor canopy cover influenced site use by 50% of study species, suggesting that backyard birds may have used a wider range of habitats during lockdowns. Human mobility affected detection of 76% of study species, suggesting that birds exhibited species-specific behavioral responses to day-to-day changes in human activity beginning shortly after initial lockdown restrictions were implemented.

  {"id":"seress2021","abstract":"The ubiquitous activity of humans is a fundamental feature of urban environments affecting local wildlife in several ways. Testing the influence of human disturbance would ideally need experimental approach, however, in cities, this is challenging at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Thus, to better understand the ecological effects of human activity, we exploited the opportunity that the city-wide lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic provided during the spring of 2020. We assessed changes in reproductive success of great tits (Parus major) at two urban habitats affected strikingly differently by the ‘anthropause’, and at an unaffected forest site. Our results do not support that urban great tits benefited from reduced human mobility during the lockdown. First, at one of our urban sites, the strongly (− 44%) reduced human disturbance in 2020 (compared to a long-term reference period) did not increase birds’ reproductive output relative to the forest habitat where human disturbance was low in all years. Second, in the other urban habitat, recreational human activity considerably increased (+ 40%) during the lockdown and this was associated with strongly reduced nestling body size compared to the pre-COVID reference year. Analyses of other environmental factors (meteorological conditions, lockdown-induced changes in air pollution) suggest that these are not likely to explain our results. Our study supports that intensified human disturbance can have adverse fitness consequences in urban populations.

  {"id":"sinnott2021","abstract":"Boundaries between vegetation types, known as ecotones, can be dynamic in response to climatic changes. The North American Great Plains includes a forest-grassland ecotone in the southcentral United States that has expanded and contracted in recent decades in response to historical periods of drought and pluvial conditions. This dynamic region also marks a western distributional limit for many passerine birds that typically breed in forests of the eastern United States. To better understand the influence that variability can exert on broad-scale biodiversity, we explored historical longitudinal shifts in the western extent of breeding ranges of eastern forest songbirds in response to the variable climate of the southern Great Plains. We used climatic niche modeling to estimate current distributional limits of nine species of forest-breeding passerines from 30-year average climate conditions from 1980 to 2010. During this time, the southern Great Plains experienced an unprecedented wet period without periodic multi-year droughts that characterized the region's long-term climate from the early 1900s. Species’ climatic niche models were then projected onto two historical drought periods: 1952–1958 and 1966–1972. Threshold models for each of the three time periods revealed dramatic breeding range contraction and expansion along the forest-grassland ecotone. Precipitation was the most important climate variable defining breeding ranges of these nine eastern forest songbirds. Range limits extended farther west into southern Great Plains during the more recent pluvial conditions of 1980–2010 and contracted during historical drought periods. An independent dataset from BBS was used to validate 1966–1972 range limit projections. Periods of lower precipitation in the forest-grassland ecotone are likely responsible for limiting the western extent of eastern forest songbird breeding distributions. Projected increases in temperature and drought conditions in the southern Great Plains associated with climate change may reverse range expansions observed in the past 30 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinnott","given":"Emily A."},{"family":"Papeş","given":"Monica"},{"family":"O’Connell","given":"Timothy J."}],"citation-key":"sinnott2021","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.7899","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"11123-11133","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Variable precipitation leads to dynamic range limits of forest songbirds at a forest-grassland ecotone","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.7899","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"soh2021","abstract":"Invasive species are a growing concern with increasing global connectivity. Feral pigeons (Columba livia) are widespread and invasive, thus their effective control is of keen international interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of a nation-wide Circuit Breaker (restricted human activities) in Singapore on first, the abundance of the feral pigeons and three urban commensals—the Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), common myna (A. tristis), and house crow (Corvus splendens) in different food source types; and second, the activity budgets of feral pigeons. A significant and progressive decline in feral pigeon abundance was observed in open food centres and feeding hotspots after the Circuit Breaker was implemented. While the house crow and common myna were less affected, the Javan myna abundance increased moderately at refuse collection centres during the Circuit Breaker and decreased significantly in green spaces after the Circuit Breaker. Changes in food abundance could also predict changes in feral pigeon abundance and its effect was greatest in feeding hotspots. A greater proportion of feral pigeons was observed foraging and moving with a smaller proportion seen resting with probable consequences on their reproductive capacity. Our study also cautions against drawing inferences on biological responses due to similar social restrictions without careful consideration of other ecological factors, like average flock size and time of the day, which also affected the proportion of pigeons foraging on natural versus anthropogenic food. In summary, our results advocate a food limitation approach to control the feral pigeon populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Soh","given":"Malcolm C.

But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Brian L."},{"family":"Aycrigg","given":"Jocelyn L."},{"family":"Barry","given":"Jessie H."},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick E."},{"family":"Bruns","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Caren B."},{"family":"Damoulas","given":"Theo"},{"family":"Dhondt","given":"André A."},{"family":"Dietterich","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Farnsworth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"John W."},{"family":"Fredericks","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Gerbracht","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Gomes","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Iliff","given":"Marshall J."},{"family":"Lagoze","given":"Carl"},{"family":"La Sorte","given":"Frank A."},{"family":"Merrifield","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Morris","given":"Will"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tina B."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Rodewald","given":"Amanda D."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Kenneth V."},{"family":"Trautmann","given":"Nancy M."},{"family":"Wiggins","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"David W."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Weng-Keen"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Kelling","given":"Steve"}],"citation-key":"sullivan2014","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.003","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-40","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The eBird enterprise: An integrated approach to development and application of citizen science","title-short":"The eBird enterprise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713003820","volume":"169"},
  {"id":"sullivan2017","abstract":"Ensuring that conservation decisions are informed by the best available data is a fundamental challenge in the face of rapid global environmental change. Too often, new science is not easily or quickly translated into conservation action. Traditional approaches to data collection and science delivery may be both inefficient and insufficient, as conservation practitioners need access to salient, credible, and legitimate data to take action. Open access data could serve as a tool to help bridge the gap between science and action, by providing conservation practitioners with access to relevant data in near real time. Broad-scale citizen-science data represent a fast-growing resource for open access databases, providing relevant and appropriately scaled data on organisms, much in the way autonomous sensors do so on the environment. Several such datasets are now broadly available, yet documentation of their application to conservation is rare. Here we use eBird, a project where individuals around the world submit data on bird distribution and abundance, as an example of how citizen-science data can be used to achieve tangible conservation science and action at local, regional, and global scales. Our examination illustrates how these data can be strategically applied to improve our understanding of spatial and temporal distributions of birds, the impacts of anthropogenic change on ecological systems, and creative conservation solutions to complex problems. We raise awareness of the types of conservation action now happening with citizen-science data, and discuss the benefits, limitations, and caveats of this approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Brian L."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Dayer","given":"Ashley A."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Farnsworth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Iliff","given":"Marshall J."},{"family":"Davies","given":"Ian J."},{"family":"Wiggins","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Rodewald","given":"Amanda D."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Kenneth V."},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Kelling","given":"Steve"}],"citation-key":"sullivan2017","collection-title":"The role of citizen science in biological conservation","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2016.04.031","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"5-14","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Using open access observational data for conservation action: A case study for birds","title-short":"Using open access observational data for conservation action","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716301689","volume":"208"},

In the United Kingdom, COVID-19 lockdown restrictions resulted in sudden, drastic alterations to human activity. We hypothesized that short-term daily and long-term seasonal changes in human mobility might result in changes in bird habitat use, depending on the mobility type (home, parks and grocery) and extent of change. Using Google human mobility data and 872 850 bird observations, we determined that during lockdown, human mobility changes resulted in altered habitat use in 80% (20/25) of our focal bird species. When humans spent more time at home, over half of affected species had lower counts, perhaps resulting from the disturbance of birds in garden habitats. Bird counts of some species (e.g. rooks and gulls) increased over the short term as humans spent more time at parks, possibly due to human-sourced food resources (e.g. picnic refuse), while counts of other species (e.g. tits and sparrows) decreased. All affected species increased counts when humans spent less time at grocery services.

For migratory birds, collisions with lighted structures are a major cause of mortality, but the mechanisms behind these collisions are poorly understood. Using 40 years of collision records of passerine birds, we investigated the importance of species' behavioural ecologies in predicting rates of building collisions during nocturnal migration through Chicago, IL and Cleveland, OH, USA. We found that the use of nocturnal flight calls is an important predictor of collision risk in nocturnally migrating passerine birds. Species that produce flight calls during nocturnal migration tended to collide with buildings more than expected given their local abundance, whereas those that do not use such communication collided much less frequently. Our results suggest that a stronger attraction response to artificial light at night in species that produce flight calls may mediate these differences in collision rates. Nocturnal flight calls probably evolved to facilitate collective decision-making during navigation, but this same social behaviour may now exacerbate vulnerability to a widespread anthropogenic disturbance. Our results also suggest that social behaviour during migration may reflect poorly understood differences in navigational mechanisms across lineages of birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Winger","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Weeks","given":"Brian C."},{"family":"Farnsworth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Andrew W."},{"family":"Hennen","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Willard","given":"David E."}],"citation-key":"winger2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2019.0364","issue":"1900","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,10]]},"page":"20190364","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Nocturnal flight-calling behaviour predicts vulnerability to artificial light in migratory birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.0364","volume":"286"},

  {"id":"youngflesh2021","abstract":"Animals and plants are shifting the timing of key life events in response to climate change, yet despite recent documentation of escalating phenological change, scientists lack a full understanding of how and why phenological responses vary across space and among species. Here, we used over 7 million community-contributed bird observations to derive species-specific, spatially explicit estimates of annual spring migration phenology for 56 bird species across eastern North America. We show that changes in the spring arrival of migratory birds are coarsely synchronized with fluctuations in vegetation green-up and that the sensitivity of birds to plant phenology varied extensively. Bird arrival responded more synchronously with vegetation green-up at higher latitudes, where phenological shifts over time are also greater. Critically, species’ migratory traits explained variation in sensitivity to green-up, with species that migrate more slowly, arrive earlier and overwinter further north showing greater responsiveness to earlier springs. Identifying how and why species vary in their ability to shift phenological events is fundamental to predicting species’ vulnerability to climate change. Such variation in sensitivity across taxa, with long-distance neotropical migrants exhibiting reduced synchrony, may help to explain substantial declines in these species over the last several decades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Youngflesh","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Socolar","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Amaral","given":"Bruna R."},{"family":"Arab","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Guralnick","given":"Robert P."},{"family":"Hurlbert","given":"Allen H."},{"family":"LaFrance","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Mayor","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"David A.

  {"id":"zhang2020","abstract":"Volunteered geographic information (VGI) can provide field samples for predictively mapping geographic phenomena. Yet the biased spatial coverage of VGI observations often undermines the fitness of use of VGI samples for predictive mapping. Although methods have been developed to mitigate spatial bias in VGI samples to improve predictive model performance, there exist limited investigations into the impacts of VGI sample size and spatial distribution characteristics on the effectiveness of the methods. This article presents an empirical evaluation on how the two factors affect the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods with a case study of mapping habitat suitability of the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) using eBird data. Results reveal positive correlations between model performance improvement and sample size, given samples of similar spatial configuration. VGI samples with more spread-out spatial coverage (i.e., more representative) are more amenable to bias mitigation. However, performance improvement plateaued beyond a certain sample size and sample representativeness thresholds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guiming"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"A-Xing"}],"citation-key":"zhang2020","container-title":"Transactions in GIS","DOI":"10.1111/tgis.12679","ISSN":"1467-9671","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"1315-1340","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Sample size and spatial configuration of volunteered geographic information affect effectiveness of spatial bias mitigation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12679","volume":"24"}
