  {"id":"hochachka2021","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has likely affected natural systems around the world; the curtailment of human activity has also affected the collection of data needed to identify the indirect effects of this pandemic on natural systems. We describe how the outbreak of COVID-19 disease, and associated stay-at-home orders in four political regions, have affected the quantity and quality of data collected by participants in one volunteer-based bird monitoring project, eBird. The four regions were selected both for their early and prolonged periods of mandated changes to human activity, and because of the high densities of observations collected. We compared the months of April 2020 with April in previous years. The most notable change was in the landscapes in which observations were made: in all but one region human-dominated landscapes were proportionally more common in the data in April 2020, and observations made near the rarer wetland habitat were less prevalent. We also found subtler changes in quantity of data collected, as well as in observer effort within observation periods. Finally, we found that these effects of COVID-19 disease varied across the political units, and thus we conclude that any analyses of eBird data will require region-specific examination of whether there have been any changes to the data collection process during the COVID-19 pandemic that would need to be taken into account.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Hany"},{"family":"Gutiérrez-Expósito","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Eliot"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"hochachka2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108974","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108974","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Regional variation in the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quantity and quality of data collected by the project eBird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000264","volume":"254"},

However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities, giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds' response to the population lockdown by using more than 126 000 bird records collected by a citizen science project in northeastern Spain. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human-emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds’ daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities. Therefore, urban birds show high behavioural plasticity to rapidly adjust to novel environmental conditions, such as those imposed by the COVID-19.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gordo","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Brotons","given":"Lluís"},{"family":"Herrando","given":"Sergi"},{"family":"Gargallo","given":"Gabriel"}],"citation-key":"gordo2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2020.2513","issue":"1946","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,10]]},"page":"20202513","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Rapid behavioural response of urban birds to COVID-19 lockdown","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.2513","volume":"288"},

  {"id":"basile2021","abstract":"In early 2020, the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led multiple countries to introduce strict lockdown measures to contain the pandemic. Movement restrictions may have influenced the ability of the public to contribute to citizen science projects. We investigated how stay-at-home orders affected data submitted by birdwatchers in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK) to a widely-used citizen science platform, iNaturalist, depending on whether observations were collected in urban or non-urban areas. We found significant trends in the daily number of observations in all three countries, indicating a surge in urban observation during lockdowns. We found an increase in the mean daily number of urban observations during the lockdown in Italy and Spain, compared to previous years. The mean daily number of non-urban observations decreased in Italy and Spain, while remained similar to previous years in the UK. We found a general decrease of new records during the lockdowns both in urban and non-urban areas in all countries. Our results suggest that the citizen science community remained active during the lockdowns and kept reporting birds from home. However, limitations to movements may have hampered the possibility of birdwatchers to explore natural areas and collect new records. Our findings suggest that future research and conservation applications of citizen science data should carefully consider the bias and gaps in data series caused by the pandemic. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of urban areas for nature activities, such as birdwatching, and its relevance for sustainable urban planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Basile","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Luca Francesco"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Valerio Giovanni"},{"family":"Senese","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Bernardo","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"basile2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109079","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109079","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Birds seen and not seen during the COVID-19 pandemic: The impact of lockdown measures on citizen science bird observations","title-short":"Birds seen and not seen during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721001312","volume":"256"},

  {"id":"randler2020","abstract":"The new corona virus infection SARS-CoV2 which was later renamed COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting public health. The fear and the constraints imposed to control the pandemic may correspondingly influence leisure activities, such as birding, which is the practice of observing birds based on visual and acoustic cues. Birders are people who carry out birding observations around the globe and contribute to the massive data collection in citizen science projects. Contrasting to earlier COVID-19 studies, which have concentrated on clinical, pathological, and virological topics, this study focused on the behavioral changes of birders. A total of 4484 questionnaire survey responses from 97 countries were received. The questionnaire had an open-ended style. About 85% of respondents reported that COVID-19 has changed their birding behavior. The most significant change in birdwatchers&rsquo; behavior was related to the geographic coverage of birding activities, which became more local. People focused mostly on yard birding. In total, 12% of respondents (n = 542 cases) reported having more time for birding, whereas 8% (n = 356 cases) reported having less time for birding. Social interactions decreased since respondents, especially older people, changed their birding behavior toward birding alone or with their spouse. Women reported more often than men that they changed to birding alone or with their spouse, and women also reported more often about canceled fieldtrips or society meetings. Respondents from higher developed countries reported that they spend currently more time for birding, especially for birding alone or with their spouse, and birding at local hotspots. Our study suggests that long lockdowns with strict regulations may severely impact on leisure activities. In addition, a temporal and spatial shift in birding due to the pandemic may influence data quality in citizen science projects. As nature-based recreation will be directed more toward nearby sites, environmental management resources and actions need to be directed to sites that are located near the users, e.g., in urban and suburban areas. The results can be applied with caution to other nature-based recreational activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Randler","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Tryjanowski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Jokimäki","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki","given":"Marja-Liisa"},{"family":"Staller","given":"Naomi"}],"citation-key":"randler2020","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph17197310","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"19","page":"7310","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) Pandemic Lockdown Influences Nature-Based Recreational Activity: The Case of Birders","title-short":"SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) Pandemic Lockdown Influences Nature-Based Recreational Activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/19/7310","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"mikula2021","abstract":"Actions taken against the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically affected many aspects of human activity, giving us a unique opportunity to study how wildlife responds to the human-induced rapid environmental changes. The wearing of face masks, widely adopted to prevent pathogen transmission, represents a novel element in many parts of the world where wearing a face mask was rare before the COVID-19 outbreak. During September 2020–March 2021, we conducted large-scale multi-species field experiments to evaluate whether face mask-use in public places elicits a behavioural response in birds by comparing their escape and alert responses when approached by a researcher with or without a face mask in four European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Poland) and Israel. We also tested whether these patterns differed between urban and rural sites. We employed Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (with phylogeny and site as random factors) controlling for a suite of covariates and found no association between the face mask-wear and flight initiation distance, alert distance, and fly-away distance, respectively, neither in urban nor in rural birds. However, we found that all three distances were strongly and consistently associated with habitat type and starting distance, with birds showing earlier escape and alert behaviour and longer distances fled when approached in rural than in urban habitats and from longer initial distances. Our results indicate that wearing face masks did not trigger observable changes in antipredator behaviour across the Western Palearctic birds, and our data did not support the role of habituation in explaining this pattern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mikula","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Jokimäki","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki","given":"Marja-Liisa"},{"family":"Markó","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Morelli","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Møller","given":"Anders Pape"},{"family":"Szakony","given":"Sára"},{"family":"Yosef","given":"Reuven"},{"family":"Albrecht","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Tryjanowski","given":"Piotr"}],"citation-key":"mikula2021","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148672","ISSN":"0048-9697","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"148672","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Face mask-wear did not affect large-scale patterns in escape and alertness of urban and rural birds during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972103744X","volume":"793"},

  {"id":"sullivan2017","abstract":"Ensuring that conservation decisions are informed by the best available data is a fundamental challenge in the face of rapid global environmental change. Too often, new science is not easily or quickly translated into conservation action. Traditional approaches to data collection and science delivery may be both inefficient and insufficient, as conservation practitioners need access to salient, credible, and legitimate data to take action. Open access data could serve as a tool to help bridge the gap between science and action, by providing conservation practitioners with access to relevant data in near real time. Broad-scale citizen-science data represent a fast-growing resource for open access databases, providing relevant and appropriately scaled data on organisms, much in the way autonomous sensors do so on the environment. Several such datasets are now broadly available, yet documentation of their application to conservation is rare. Here we use eBird, a project where individuals around the world submit data on bird distribution and abundance, as an example of how citizen-science data can be used to achieve tangible conservation science and action at local, regional, and global scales.

  {"id":"soh2021","abstract":"Invasive species are a growing concern with increasing global connectivity. Feral pigeons (Columba livia) are widespread and invasive, thus their effective control is of keen international interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of a nation-wide Circuit Breaker (restricted human activities) in Singapore on first, the abundance of the feral pigeons and three urban commensals—the Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), common myna (A. tristis), and house crow (Corvus splendens) in different food source types; and second, the activity budgets of feral pigeons. A significant and progressive decline in feral pigeon abundance was observed in open food centres and feeding hotspots after the Circuit Breaker was implemented. While the house crow and common myna were less affected, the Javan myna abundance increased moderately at refuse collection centres during the Circuit Breaker and decreased significantly in green spaces after the Circuit Breaker. Changes in food abundance could also predict changes in feral pigeon abundance and its effect was greatest in feeding hotspots. A greater proportion of feral pigeons was observed foraging and moving with a smaller proportion seen resting with probable consequences on their reproductive capacity. Our study also cautions against drawing inferences on biological responses due to similar social restrictions without careful consideration of other ecological factors, like average flock size and time of the day, which also affected the proportion of pigeons foraging on natural versus anthropogenic food. In summary, our results advocate a food limitation approach to control the feral pigeon populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Soh","given":"Malcolm C.

The large human lockdown and its eventual relaxation can be viewed as a Global Human Confinement Experiment. This experiment is a unique opportunity to identify positive and negative effects of human presence and mobility on a range of natural systems, including wildlife, and protected areas, and to study processes regulating biodiversity and ecosystems. We encourage ecologists, environmental scientists, and resource managers to contribute their observations to efforts aiming to build comprehensive global understanding based on multiple data streams, including anecdotal observations, systematic assessments and quantitative monitoring. We argue that the collective power of combining diverse data will transcend the limited value of the individual data sets and produce unexpected insights. We can also consider the confinement experiment as a “stress test” to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in the adequacy of existing networks to detect human impacts on natural systems. Doing so will provide evidence for the value of the conservation strategies that are presently in place, and create future networks, observatories and policies that are more adept in protecting biological diversity across the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bates","given":"Amanda E."},{"family":"Primack","given":"Richard B."},{"family":"Moraga","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Duarte","given":"Carlos M."}],"citation-key":"bates2020","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108665","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108665","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown as a “Global Human Confinement Experiment” to investigate biodiversity conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720307230","volume":"248"},

But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Brian L."},{"family":"Aycrigg","given":"Jocelyn L."},{"family":"Barry","given":"Jessie H."},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick E."},{"family":"Bruns","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Caren B."},{"family":"Damoulas","given":"Theo"},{"family":"Dhondt","given":"André A."},{"family":"Dietterich","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Farnsworth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"John W."},{"family":"Fredericks","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Gerbracht","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Gomes","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Iliff","given":"Marshall J."},{"family":"Lagoze","given":"Carl"},{"family":"La Sorte","given":"Frank A."},{"family":"Merrifield","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Morris","given":"Will"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tina B."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Rodewald","given":"Amanda D."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Kenneth V."},{"family":"Trautmann","given":"Nancy M."},{"family":"Wiggins","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"David W."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Weng-Keen"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Kelling","given":"Steve"}],"citation-key":"sullivan2014","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.003","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-40","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The eBird enterprise: An integrated approach to development and application of citizen science","title-short":"The eBird enterprise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713003820","volume":"169"},

  {"id":"sinnott2021","abstract":"Boundaries between vegetation types, known as ecotones, can be dynamic in response to climatic changes. The North American Great Plains includes a forest-grassland ecotone in the southcentral United States that has expanded and contracted in recent decades in response to historical periods of drought and pluvial conditions. This dynamic region also marks a western distributional limit for many passerine birds that typically breed in forests of the eastern United States. To better understand the influence that variability can exert on broad-scale biodiversity, we explored historical longitudinal shifts in the western extent of breeding ranges of eastern forest songbirds in response to the variable climate of the southern Great Plains. We used climatic niche modeling to estimate current distributional limits of nine species of forest-breeding passerines from 30-year average climate conditions from 1980 to 2010. During this time, the southern Great Plains experienced an unprecedented wet period without periodic multi-year droughts that characterized the region's long-term climate from the early 1900s. Species’ climatic niche models were then projected onto two historical drought periods: 1952–1958 and 1966–1972. Threshold models for each of the three time periods revealed dramatic breeding range contraction and expansion along the forest-grassland ecotone. Precipitation was the most important climate variable defining breeding ranges of these nine eastern forest songbirds. Range limits extended farther west into southern Great Plains during the more recent pluvial conditions of 1980–2010 and contracted during historical drought periods. An independent dataset from BBS was used to validate 1966–1972 range limit projections. Periods of lower precipitation in the forest-grassland ecotone are likely responsible for limiting the western extent of eastern forest songbird breeding distributions. Projected increases in temperature and drought conditions in the southern Great Plains associated with climate change may reverse range expansions observed in the past 30 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinnott","given":"Emily A."},{"family":"Papeş","given":"Monica"},{"family":"O’Connell","given":"Timothy J."}],"citation-key":"sinnott2021","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.7899","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"11123-11133","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Variable precipitation leads to dynamic range limits of forest songbirds at a forest-grassland ecotone","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.7899","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"aoki2021","abstract":"Long-distance dispersal (LDD) outside a species' breeding range contributes to genetic divergence. Previous phylogeographic studies of migratory bird species have not discriminated LDD from vicariant speciation in their diversification process. We conducted an integrative phylogeographic approach to test the LDD hypothesis, which predicts that a Japanese migratory bird subspecies diverged from a population in the coastal region of the East China Sea (CRECS) via LDD over the East China Sea (ECS). Haplotype networks of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes of its three subspecies were reconstructed to examine whether the Japanese subspecies of the Brown Shrike (Lanius cristatus superciliosus) diverged from an ancestral CRECS population. A species distribution model (SDM) for the Japanese subspecies was constructed using bioclimatic variables under the maximum entropy algorithm. It was projected backwards to the climate of the last glacial maximum (LGM) to infer the candidate source area of colonization. A migratory route of L. c. superciliosus, which possibly reflects a candidate past colonization route, was tracked by light-level geolocators. Molecular phylogenetic networks suggest that the Japanese subspecies diverged from a population in the CRECS and maintained anciently diverged haplotypes. The SDM inferred that the emerged continental shelf of the ECS and the present CRECS were suitable breeding areas for the Japanese subspecies during the LGM. A major migratory route for L. c. superciliosus was inferred between the CRECS and the Japanese archipelago across the ECS. Our integrative approach supported the LDD hypothesis for divergence of the Japanese subspecies of the Brown Shrike. Shrinkage of the ECS may have been responsible for successful population establishment, due to a sufficient number of migrants overshooting to the Japanese archipelago from the CRECS. Our framework provides a new phylogeographic scenario for this region. Discriminating LDD and vicariance models helps improve our understanding of the phylogeographic histories of migratory species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Aoki","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Sakamoto","given":"Haruna"},{"family":"Kitazawa","given":"Munehiro"},{"family":"Kryukov","given":"Alexey P."},{"family":"Takagi","given":"Masaoki"}],"citation-key":"aoki2021","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.7387","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"6066-6079","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Migration-tracking integrated phylogeography supports long-distance dispersal-driven divergence for a migratory bird species in the Japanese archipelago","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.7387","volume":"11"},

Here, we used over 7 million community-contributed bird observations to derive species-specific, spatially explicit estimates of annual spring migration phenology for 56 bird species across eastern North America. We show that changes in the spring arrival of migratory birds are coarsely synchronized with fluctuations in vegetation green-up and that the sensitivity of birds to plant phenology varied extensively. Bird arrival responded more synchronously with vegetation green-up at higher latitudes, where phenological shifts over time are also greater. Critically, species’ migratory traits explained variation in sensitivity to green-up, with species that migrate more slowly, arrive earlier and overwinter further north showing greater responsiveness to earlier springs. Identifying how and why species vary in their ability to shift phenological events is fundamental to predicting species’ vulnerability to climate change. Such variation in sensitivity across taxa, with long-distance neotropical migrants exhibiting reduced synchrony, may help to explain substantial declines in these species over the last several decades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Youngflesh","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Socolar","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Amaral","given":"Bruna R."},{"family":"Arab","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Guralnick","given":"Robert P."},{"family":"Hurlbert","given":"Allen H."},{"family":"LaFrance","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Mayor","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"David A.

We modeled the niches of the MWP and its five most important long-horned beetle prey species, quantifying their similarity in spatial distribution and niche. Then we evaluated the relative importance of single prey species and prey species richness on the potential distribution of the MWP, which showed a high degree of overlap with the niche and spatial distribution of three prey species. MWP models with each of these three prey species had a better fit than the model with prey species richness, and contributed more than environmental variables. These results suggest that MWP responds to particular prey items rather than prey species richness.

For migratory birds, collisions with lighted structures are a major cause of mortality, but the mechanisms behind these collisions are poorly understood. Using 40 years of collision records of passerine birds, we investigated the importance of species' behavioural ecologies in predicting rates of building collisions during nocturnal migration through Chicago, IL and Cleveland, OH, USA. We found that the use of nocturnal flight calls is an important predictor of collision risk in nocturnally migrating passerine birds. Species that produce flight calls during nocturnal migration tended to collide with buildings more than expected given their local abundance, whereas those that do not use such communication collided much less frequently. Our results suggest that a stronger attraction response to artificial light at night in species that produce flight calls may mediate these differences in collision rates. Nocturnal flight calls probably evolved to facilitate collective decision-making during navigation, but this same social behaviour may now exacerbate vulnerability to a widespread anthropogenic disturbance. Our results also suggest that social behaviour during migration may reflect poorly understood differences in navigational mechanisms across lineages of birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Winger","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Weeks","given":"Brian C."},{"family":"Farnsworth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Andrew W."},{"family":"Hennen","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Willard","given":"David E."}],"citation-key":"winger2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2019.0364","issue":"1900","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,10]]},"page":"20190364","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Nocturnal flight-calling behaviour predicts vulnerability to artificial light in migratory birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.0364","volume":"286"},

We also used cluster analysis to elucidate participation patterns, and we assessed changes in the geographical distribution of observation sites. The results showed: (1) the number of participants and observations decreased by 63% and 68%, respectively; however, the number of species was almost the same in the two years, and the identification rate increased 154% in 2020 relative to 2019. (2) The most enthusiastic participants contributed in similar amounts in 2019 and 2020, but participation by less enthusiastic volunteers drastically declined. (3) The spatial distribution of observation sites changed from cluster-like to scattered. Understanding participant engagement during the pandemic could help to improve data quality, reduce geographical bias in observations, maintain records, and recruit more users in future years. Online citizen science could provide opportunities for many citizens to get outside and participate in conservation science during and after the pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kishimoto","given":"Keidai"},{"family":"Kobori","given":"Hiromi"}],"citation-key":"kishimoto2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109001","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109001","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"COVID-19 pandemic drives changes in participation in citizen science project “City Nature Challenge” in Tokyo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000537","volume":"255"},
  {"id":"kelling2019","abstract":"Biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate, and monitoring is crucial for understanding the causal drivers and assessing solutions. Most biodiversity monitoring data are collected by volunteers through citizen science projects, and often crucial information is lacking to account for the inevitable biases that observers introduce during data collection. We contend that citizen science projects intended to support biodiversity monitoring must gather information about the observation process as well as species occurrence. We illustrate this using eBird, a global citizen science project that collects information on bird occurrences as well as vital contextual information on the observation process while maintaining broad participation. Our fundamental argument is that regardless of what species are being monitored, when citizen science projects collect a small set of basic information about how participants make their observations, the scientific value of the data collected will be dramatically improved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelling","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Bonn","given":"Aletta"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Ruiz-Gutierrez","given":"Viviana"},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M"},{"family":"Julliard","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Kraemer","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Guralnick","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"kelling2019","container-title":"BioScience","container-title-short":"BioScience","DOI":"10.1093/biosci/biz010","ISSN":"0006-3568","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"page":"170-179","source":"Silverchair","title":"Using Semistructured Surveys to Improve Citizen Science Data for Monitoring Biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biz010","volume":"69"},
  {"id":"macphail2020","abstract":"Citizen science is a rapidly growing field whereby volunteers can collect and/or analyze data to contribute to research and gain an appreciation for the environment. There are countless programs currently underway around the world: some have clear scientific hypotheses being tested and others are simple data gathering; some are designed and led at the grass-roots level while others are done by academics. This review focusses on best practices for the development and running of citizen science projects to make them successful. It includes discussion around different methods of experimental design, data collection, and analyses; how participants are recruited, engaged, and rewarded (including who participates and why); the effect of participation on the volunteer's knowledge and actions; and the impact programs have on policy and other conservation actions. While there are several challenges that projects face, and more research is needed in various areas, the many benefits support the continued expansion of citizen science projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"MacPhail","given":"Victoria J."},{"family":"Colla","given":"Sheila R."}],"citation-key":"macphail2020","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108739","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108739","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Power of the people: A review of citizen science programs for conservation","title-short":"Power of the people","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720307977","volume":"249"},
  {"id":"pocock2017","abstract":"Citizen science—the involvement of volunteers in data collection, analysis and interpretation—simultaneously supports research and public engagement with science, and its profile is rapidly rising. Citizen science represents a diverse range of approaches, but until now this diversity has not been quantitatively explored. We conducted a systematic internet search and discovered 509 environmental and ecological citizen science projects. We scored each project for 32 attributes based on publicly obtainable information and used multiple factor analysis to summarise this variation to assess citizen science approaches. We found that projects varied according to their methodological approach from ‘mass participation’ (e.g. easy participation by anyone anywhere) to ‘systematic monitoring’ (e.g. trained volunteers repeatedly sampling at specific locations). They also varied in complexity from approaches that are ‘simple’ to those that are ‘elaborate’ (e.g. provide lots of support to gather rich, detailed datasets). There was a separate cluster of entirely computer-based projects but, in general, we found that the range of citizen science projects in ecology and the environment showed continuous variation and cannot be neatly categorised into distinct types of activity. While the diversity of projects begun in each time period (pre 1990, 1990–99, 2000–09 and 2010–13) has not increased, we found that projects tended to have become increasingly different from each other as time progressed (possibly due to changing opportunities, including technological innovation). Most projects were still active so consequently we found that the overall diversity of active projects (available for participation) increased as time progressed. Overall, understanding the landscape of citizen science in ecology and the environment (and its change over time) is valuable because it informs the comparative evaluation of the ‘success’ of different citizen science approaches. Comparative evaluation provides an evidence-base to inform the future development of citizen science activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pocock","given":"Michael J.

  {"id":"ruiz-gutierrez2021","abstract":"The research and conservation community has successfully harnessed the wealth of ecological knowledge found in unprecedented volumes of citizen science (CS) data world-wide. However, few examples exist of the use of CS data to directly inform policy. Current examples of applications of CS data mainly stem from programs that are restricted in scope (e.g. defined protocols, restricted sampling time frame), and the potential use of unrestricted CS data to inform policy remains largely untapped. Here, we make a call for moving beyond questioning the reliability of CS data and present a case study of how the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) used information from an unrestricted CS program (eBird) to inform levels of exposure to collision risk for wind energy development. Policy implications. The USFWS made the technical recommendation to use eBird abundance estimates for the bald eagle as the only source of information to define low-risk collision areas as part of the agency's wind energy permitting process. Our study contributes a clear pathway of how to realize the potential of unrestricted CS programs for generating the evidence base needed to inform policy decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruiz-Gutierrez","given":"Viviana"},{"family":"Bjerre","given":"Emily R."},{"family":"Otto","given":"Mark C."},{"family":"Zimmerman","given":"Guthrie S."},{"family":"Millsap","given":"Brian A."},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Stuber","given":"Erica F."},{"family":"Strimas-Mackey","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Orin J."}],"citation-key":"ruiz-gutierrez2021","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.13870","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1104-1111","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A pathway for citizen science data to inform policy: A case study using eBird data for defining low-risk collision areas for wind energy development","title-short":"A pathway for citizen science data to inform policy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13870","volume":"58"},
  {"id":"bates2021","abstract":"The global lockdown to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic health risks has altered human interactions with nature. Here, we report immediate impacts of changes in human activities on wildlife and environmental threats during the early lockdown months of 2020, based on 877 qualitative reports and 332 quantitative assessments from 89 different studies. Hundreds of reports of unusual species observations from around the world suggest that animals quickly responded to the reductions in human presence. However, negative effects of lockdown on conservation also emerged, as confinement resulted in some park officials being unable to perform conservation, restoration and enforcement tasks, resulting in local increases in illegal activities such as hunting. Overall, there is a complex mixture of positive and negative effects of the pandemic lockdown on nature, all of which have the potential to lead to cascading responses which in turn impact wildlife and nature conservation. While the net effect of the lockdown will need to be assessed over years as data becomes available and persistent effects emerge, immediate responses were detected across the world. Thus, initial qualitative and quantitative data arising from this serendipitous global quasi-experimental perturbation highlights the dual role that humans play in threatening and protecting species and ecosystems. Pathways to favorably tilt this delicate balance include reducing impacts and increasing conservation effectiveness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bates","given":"Amanda E."},{"family":"Primack","given":"Richard B."},{"family":"Biggar","given":"Brandy S."},{"family":"Bird","given":"Tomas J."},{"family":"Clinton","given":"Mary E."},{"family":"Command","given":"Rylan J."},{"family":"Richards","given":"Cerren"},{"family":"Shellard","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Geraldi","given":"Nathan R."},{"family":"Vergara","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Acevedo-Charry","given":"Orlando"},{"family":"Colón-Piñeiro","given":"Zuania"},{"family":"Ocampo","given":"David"},{"family":"Ocampo-Peñuela","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Sánchez-Clavijo","given":"Lina M."},{"family":"Adamescu","given":"Cristian M."},{"family":"Cheval","given":"Sorin"},{"family":"Racoviceanu","given":"Tudor"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Kalisa","given":"Egide"},{"family":"Kuuire","given":"Vincent Z."},{"family":"Aditya","given":"Vikram"},{"family":"Anderwald","given":"Pia"},{"family":"Wiesmann","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Wipf","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Badihi","given":"Gal"},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Matthew G."},{"family":"Loetscher","given":"Hanspeter"},{"family":"Baerenfaller","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Benedetti-Cecchi","given":"Lisandro"},{"family":"Bulleri","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Bertocci","given":"Iacopo"},{"family":"Maggi","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Rindi","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Ravaglioli","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Boerder","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Bonnel","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Mathias","given":"Delphine"},{"family":"Archambault","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Chauvaud","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Braun","given":"Camrin D."},{"family":"Thorrold","given":"Simon R."},{"family":"Brownscombe","given":"Jacob W."},{"family":"Midwood","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Boston","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Jill L."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"China","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Roll","given":"Uri"},{"family":"Belmaker","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Zvuloni","given":"Assaf"},{"family":"Coll","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Ortega","given":"Miquel"},{"family":"Connors","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Lacko","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Jayathilake","given":"Dinusha R.

  {"id":"neate-clegg2020","abstract":"Systematic monitoring of species across their geographic ranges is a critical part of conservation but it is resource-intensive, costly, and difficult to organize and maintain in the long-term. Large-scale community science programs like eBird may improve our ability to monitor bird populations, particularly in tropical regions where formal studies are lacking. Here, we estimated population trends for nearly 9000 bird species using global eBird birdwatching data and compared our trends to the population trends designated by BirdLife International. We calculated the rate of agreement between eBird and BirdLife trends and examined the effects of latitudinal affiliation, threat status, number of eBird checklists, eBird trend, BirdLife trend and BirdLife trend derivation on the rate of agreement. We also used a randomization approach to compare observed rates of agreement with the rates of agreement expected by chance alone. We show that the rate of agreement was marginally better than expected by chance and improved significantly for temperate region species of Least Concern with more checklists, and species that eBird or BirdLife identified as increasing. Our results suggest that eBird data are not currently adequate for monitoring populations of the majority of the world's bird species, especially in the developing world where systematic surveys are essential. Increased local participation in community science initiatives like eBird may improve our ability to effectively monitor species. Furthermore, it is important to assess the accuracy of BirdLife trends and the manner in which they are derived, especially for species where BirdLife and eBird data trends disagree.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Neate-Clegg","given":"Montague H.

The absence of tourists in 2020 lead to a sevenfold increase in presence of white-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla, a sevenfold increase in their disturbance of breeding common murres Uria aalge and causing 26% lower murre productivity than the long-term average. Eagles did not prey on murres, but their frequent disturbances delayed egg laying and facilitated egg predation from herring gulls Larus argentatus and hooded crows Corvus cornix. Based on our findings, we suggest that human presence could be used as a strategic measure in guarding seabird colonies, and that a social-ecological systems perspective is vital for long-term success in protected area management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hentati-Sundberg","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Berglund","given":"Per-Arvid"},{"family":"Hejdström","given":"Aron"},{"family":"Olsson","given":"Olof"}],"citation-key":"hentati-sundberg2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108950","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"108950","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"COVID-19 lockdown reveals tourists as seabird guardians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000021","volume":"254"},

We leverage an increase in balcony birdwatching, a million eBird entries, and difference-in-difference techniques to test if urban avian species richness rose during India's COVID-19 lockdown. Controlling for effort, birdwatchers in the 20 most populous cities observed a 16% increase in the number of species during lockdown. While human activity stopped overnight, and noise and visual pollution decreased soon after, increased species diversity was observed 1–2 weeks later; evidence that gradual population recovery, not better detection, underlay our results. We find at-risk, and rare, species among those reclaiming cities, implying that reducing human disturbance in urban areas can protect threatened species. Increased species diversity likely derives from a reduction in noise and air pollution associated with the lockdown, implying that urban planners should consider conservation co-benefits of urban policies when designing sustainable cities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Madhok","given":"Raahil"},{"family":"Gulati","given":"Sumeet"}],"citation-key":"madhok2022","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109597","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109597","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ruling the roost: Avian species reclaim urban habitat during India's COVID-19 lockdown","title-short":"Ruling the roost","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320722001501","volume":"271"},

  {"id":"fritz2013","abstract":"Spatial cluster analysis is a uniquely interdisciplinary endeavour, and so it is important to communicate and disseminate ideas, innovations, best practices and challenges across practitioners, applied epidemiology researchers and spatial statisticians. In this research we conducted a scoping review to systematically search peer-reviewed journal databases for research that has employed spatial cluster analysis methods on individual-level, address location, or x and y coordinate derived data. To illustrate the thematic issues raised by our results, methods were tested using a dataset where known clusters existed. Point pattern methods, spatial clustering and cluster detection tests, and a locally weighted spatial regression model were most commonly used for individual-level, address location data (n = 29). The spatial scan statistic was the most popular method for address location data (n = 19). Six themes were identified relating to the application of spatial cluster analysis methods and subsequent analyses, which we recommend researchers to consider; exploratory analysis, visualization, spatial resolution, aetiology, scale and spatial weights. It is our intention that researchers seeking direction for using spatial cluster analysis methods, consider the caveats and strengths of each approach, but also explore the numerous other methods available for this type of analysis. Applied spatial epidemiology researchers and practitioners should give special consideration to applying multiple tests to a dataset. Future research should focus on developing frameworks for selecting appropriate methods and the corresponding spatial weighting schemes.","author":[{"family":"Fritz","given":"Charles E."},{"family":"Schuurman","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Lear","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"fritz2013","container-title":"Geospatial Health","container-title-short":"Geospat Health","DOI":"10.4081/gh.2013.79","ISSN":"1970-7096","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"183-198","PMID":"23733283","source":"PubMed","title":"A scoping review of spatial cluster analysis techniques for point-event data","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Anselin","given":"Luc"}],"citation-key":"anselin1995","container-title":"Geographical Analysis","DOI":"10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x","ISSN":"1538-4632","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","page":"93-115","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x","volume":"27"},

The procedure, known as the Mantel test in the biological and environmental sciences, includes any analysis relating two distance matrices or, more generally, two proximity matrices. In this paper, we discuss the extent to which a Mantel type of analysis between two proximity matrices agrees with Pearson's correlation analysis when both methods are applicable (i.e., the raw data used to calculate proximities are available). First, we demonstrate that the Mantel test and Pearson's correlation analysis should lead to a similar decision regarding their respective null hypothesis when squared Euclidean distances are used in the Mantel test and the raw bivariate data are normally distributed. Then we use fish and zooplankton biomass data from Lake Erie (North American Great Lakes) to show that Pearson's correlation statistic may be nonsignificant while the Mantel statistic calculated on nonsquared Euclidean distances is significant. After small-size artificial examples, seven bivariate distributional models are tried to simulate data reproducing the difference between analyses, among which three do reproduce it. These results and some extensions are discussed. In conclusion, particular attention must be paid whenever relations established between proximities are backtransposed to raw data, especially when these may display patterns described in the body of this paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Dutilleul","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Jason D."},{"family":"Frigon","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Legendre","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"dutilleul2000","container-title":"Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics","DOI":"10.2307/1400528","ISSN":"1085-7117","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"131-150","publisher":"[International Biometric Society, Springer]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Mantel Test versus Pearson's Correlation Analysis: Assessment of the Differences for Biological and Environmental Studies","title-short":"The Mantel Test versus Pearson's Correlation Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400528","volume":"5"},

Mixture random variables that include heteroscedasticity or overdispersion also are explored. In addition, a simple asymptotic variance for the Moran coefficient is presented, assessed, and found to be very precise for sample sizes as small as 25–100. The principal conclusion is that independence and sample size are the most relevant properties for Pitman–Koopmans theorem results to be extended to non-normal random variables.

However, the anthropause resulting from COVID–19 lockdowns provided an unprecedented scenario to study the relative role of human activity on avian communities. Here we provide evidence of the relationships between human activity and bird species richness in urban areas of Colombia during its strict and subsequent relaxed lockdowns. Once the strict lockdown was lifted and human activity increased, avian species richness decreased by 32 % in 46 % of our sampling sites. Although the strict lockdown lasted only six weeks, local assemblages (mainly from low–intensity urbanization peri–urban sites) swiftly became more diverse. Our findings highlight the importance of taking human activity into account when planning cities, with important focus on greenspaces, if our aim is to conserve and enhance urban biodiversity. Such plans will require not only the cooperation of local governments but also greater awareness among the local population regarding the importance of creating livable, healthy, biodiverse, and resilient cities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"MacGregor","given":"I."},{"family":"Arbeláez–Cortés","given":"E."},{"family":"Estela","given":"F.

We compared the number of participants, observations submitted, and proportion of observations collected in urban environments in spring 2020 to the expected values for these metrics based on activity in the previous five years (2015–2019), which in many cases exhibited underlying growth. At the national scale, eButterfly and Nature's Notebook exhibited declines in the number of participants and number of observations submitted during the spring of 2020 and iNaturalist and eBird showed growth in both measures. On a state-by-state basis, the patterns varied geographically and by program. The more popular programs – iNaturalist and eBird – exhibited increases in the Eastern U.S. in both the number of observations and participants and slight declines in the West. Further, there was a widespread increase in observations originating from urban areas, particularly in iNaturalist and eBird. Understanding the impacts of lockdowns on participation patterns in these programs is crucial for proper interpretation of the data. The data generated by these programs are highly valuable for documenting impacts of pandemic-related closures on wildlife and plants and may suggest patterns seen in other community science programs and in other countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Crimmins","given":"Theresa M."},{"family":"Posthumus","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Schaffer","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Prudic","given":"Kathleen L."}],"citation-key":"crimmins2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109017","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"109017","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"COVID-19 impacts on participation in large scale biodiversity-themed community science projects in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000690","volume":"256"},
  {"id":"seress2021","abstract":"The ubiquitous activity of humans is a fundamental feature of urban environments affecting local wildlife in several ways. Testing the influence of human disturbance would ideally need experimental approach, however, in cities, this is challenging at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Thus, to better understand the ecological effects of human activity, we exploited the opportunity that the city-wide lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic provided during the spring of 2020. We assessed changes in reproductive success of great tits (Parus major) at two urban habitats affected strikingly differently by the ‘anthropause’, and at an unaffected forest site. Our results do not support that urban great tits benefited from reduced human mobility during the lockdown. First, at one of our urban sites, the strongly (− 44%) reduced human disturbance in 2020 (compared to a long-term reference period) did not increase birds’ reproductive output relative to the forest habitat where human disturbance was low in all years. Second, in the other urban habitat, recreational human activity considerably increased (+ 40%) during the lockdown and this was associated with strongly reduced nestling body size compared to the pre-COVID reference year. Analyses of other environmental factors (meteorological conditions, lockdown-induced changes in air pollution) suggest that these are not likely to explain our results. Our study supports that intensified human disturbance can have adverse fitness consequences in urban populations. It also highlights that a few months of ‘anthropause’ is not enough to counterweight the detrimental impacts of urbanization on local wildlife populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Seress","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Sándor","given":"Krisztina"},{"family":"Vincze","given":"Ernő"},{"family":"Pipoly","given":"Ivett"},{"family":"Bukor","given":"Boglárka"},{"family":"Ágh","given":"Nóra"},{"family":"Liker","given":"András"}],"citation-key":"seress2021","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-96858-8","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,3]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"17649","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Contrasting effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on urban birds’ reproductive success in two cities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96858-8","volume":"11"},

In the United Kingdom, COVID-19 lockdown restrictions resulted in sudden, drastic alterations to human activity. We hypothesized that short-term daily and long-term seasonal changes in human mobility might result in changes in bird habitat use, depending on the mobility type (home, parks and grocery) and extent of change. Using Google human mobility data and 872 850 bird observations, we determined that during lockdown, human mobility changes resulted in altered habitat use in 80% (20/25) of our focal bird species. When humans spent more time at home, over half of affected species had lower counts, perhaps resulting from the disturbance of birds in garden habitats. Bird counts of some species (e.g. rooks and gulls) increased over the short term as humans spent more time at parks, possibly due to human-sourced food resources (e.g. picnic refuse), while counts of other species (e.g. tits and sparrows) decreased. All affected species increased counts when humans spent less time at grocery services. Avian species rapidly adjusted to the novel environmental conditions and demonstrated behavioural plasticity, but with diverse responses, reflecting the different interactions and pressures caused by human activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Warrington","given":"Miyako H."},{"family":"Schrimpf","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Des Brisay","given":"Paulson"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Michelle E."},{"family":"Koper","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"warrington2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2021.2740","issue":"1983","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,21]]},"page":"20212740","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Avian behaviour changes in response to human activity during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2021.2740","volume":"289"},

Our goals were twofold: (1) consider how intensity of urbanization, canopy cover, and availability of bird feeders and bird baths influenced avian habitat use; and (2) quantify how daily changes in weather, air pollution, and human mobility influenced detection of birds. We analyzed 6,640 surveys from 367 volunteers at 429 monitoring sites using occupancy models for 46 study species. Neither land cover nor canopy cover influenced site use by 50% of study species, suggesting that backyard birds may have used a wider range of habitats during lockdowns. Human mobility affected detection of 76% of study species, suggesting that birds exhibited species-specific behavioral responses to day-to-day changes in human activity beginning shortly after initial lockdown restrictions were implemented.

  {"id":"greenwood1995","abstract":"It is important to monitor bird populations both in their own right and as indicators of the general health of wildlife habitats. The objectives of the British Trust for Ornithology's Integrated Population Monitoring programme relate to breeding bird populations in Britain and Ireland and involve the estimation of demographic parameters as well as assessment of numbers. Current programmes for monitoring bird numbers cover the majority of British species; it would be feasible to monitor most of the rest. A new Breeding Bird Survey has been developed to provide effective coverage of all regions and all major habitats in Britain through random sampling, allowing for the marked geographical variation in volunteer observer density. The final choice of a random sample stratified by observer density (with some professional support in regions with few volunteer observers) was based on comparison with alternative stratifications, using data from a 2-year pilot study to assess the number of species adequately covered under various alternatives. A method of assessing whether or not targets are being achieved at any time has been developed: it involves looking back through the data at intervals of 1-year, 4-year, 16-year and longer spans. It will be possible to refine this by incorporating environmental and density-dependent effects into predictive models. The method is illustrated here using Common Birds Census data. We discuss associated problems of statistical inference and of taking decisions under uncertainty. The data provide evidence for large declines in some species, particularly in farmland; the value of birds as general indicators of habitat health is clear. The results of monitoring can be used to illuminate possible causes of problems and to guide both practical steps to ameliorate the problems and research aimed at better understanding the causes.

  {"id":"dicecco2021","abstract":"The availability of citizen science data has resulted in growing applications in biodiversity science. One widely used platform, iNaturalist, provides millions of digitally vouchered observations submitted by a global user base. These observation records include a date and a location but otherwise do not contain any information about the sampling process. As a result, sampling biases must be inferred from the data themselves. In the present article, we examine spatial and temporal biases in iNaturalist observations from the platform's launch in 2008 through the end of 2019. We also characterize user behavior on the platform in terms of individual activity level and taxonomic specialization. We found that, at the level of taxonomic class, the users typically specialized on a particular group, especially plants or insects, and rarely made observations of the same species twice. Biodiversity scientists should consider whether user behavior results in systematic biases in their analyses before using iNaturalist data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Cecco","given":"Grace J"},{"family":"Barve","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Belitz","given":"Michael W"},{"family":"Stucky","given":"Brian J"},{"family":"Guralnick","given":"Robert P"},{"family":"Hurlbert","given":"Allen H"}],"citation-key":"dicecco2021","container-title":"BioScience","container-title-short":"BioScience","DOI":"10.1093/biosci/biab093","ISSN":"0006-3568","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"1179-1188","source":"Silverchair","title":"Observing the Observers: How Participants Contribute Data to iNaturalist and Implications for Biodiversity Science","title-short":"Observing the Observers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biab093","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"johnston2021","abstract":"Aim Ecological data collected by the general public are valuable for addressing a wide range of ecological research and conservation planning, and there has been a rapid increase in the scope and volume of data available. However, data from eBird or other large-scale projects with volunteer observers typically present several challenges that can impede robust ecological inferences. These challenges include spatial bias, variation in effort and species reporting bias. Innovation We use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a community science or citizen science (CS) project. We estimate two widely used metrics of species distributions: encounter rate and occupancy probability. For each metric, we critically assess the impact of data processing steps that either degrade or refine the data used in the analyses. CS data density varies widely across the globe, so we also test whether differences in model performance are robust to sample size. Main conclusions Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from CS data; however, the degree of improvement varied with species and data density. The largest gains we observed in model performance were achieved with 1) the use of complete checklists (where observers report all the species they detect and identify, allowing non-detections to be inferred) and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Occupancy models were more robust to a lack of complete checklists. Improvements in model performance with data refinement were more evident with larger sample sizes. In general, we found that the value of each refinement varied by situation and we encourage researchers to assess the benefits in other scenarios. These approaches will enable researchers to more effectively harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within CS data for conservation and basic research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Strimas-Mackey","given":"Matthew E."},{"family":"Ruiz Gutierrez","given":"Viviana"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Orin J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Eliot T."},{"family":"Auer","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Kelling","given":"Steve T."},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"johnston2021","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/ddi.13271","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1265-1277","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Analytical guidelines to increase the value of community science data: An example using eBird data to estimate species distributions","title-short":"Analytical guidelines to increase the value of community science data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.13271","volume":"27"},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bates","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Mächler","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Bolker","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Steve"}],"citation-key":"bates2015","container-title":"Journal of Statistical Software","DOI":"10.18637/jss.v067.i01","ISSN":"1548-7660","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2015 Douglas Bates, Martin Mächler, Ben Bolker, Steve Walker","page":"1-48","source":"www.jstatsoft.org","title":"Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v067.i01","volume":"67"},

  {"id":"norman2012","abstract":"Capsule Line transect data from large-scale common bird monitoring schemes can be used to provide population estimates for many common and widespread species at a regional level. Aims To test the sample sizes necessary to derive regional population figures and to explore the precision, accuracy and bias of the results. Methods As a case study, distance sampling methodology was applied to transect survey data from the ornithological recording area of Cheshire and Wirral (England), which constitutes about 1% of UK land area. We used data from 109 transects, either surveyed through the UK Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) in 2004 or 2005 or from a project in 2005 to monitor farms in the Entry Level Stewardship Scheme (ELS); this is 1 in 23 of the 1-km squares in the region. Results There were sufficient observations to fit robust detection functions and produce regional-scale population estimates for 61 species – half of the 122 regularly breeding species. Population estimates were further derived for another 16 less common species by applying a detection function from a more common surrogate species. However, some of these population estimates are not considered to be accurate, as judged by local knowledge, the species' distribution shown by a recent tetrad-scale atlas, and as a proportion of the national figures calculated from the national BBS data. The most precise estimates are for species that are evenly distributed across the study area, with decreasing precision for those with a more clumped distribution or species occurring in restricted habitats. Conclusion The present study highlights the potential of these methods and national bird monitoring data for deriving population estimates for many species at a smaller regional scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Norman","given":"David"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Robert   J."},{"family":"Newson","given":"Stuart   E."}],"citation-key":"norman2012","container-title":"Bird Study","DOI":"10.1080/00063657.2011.623766","ISSN":"0006-3657","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,1]]},"page":"10-21","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Producing regional estimates of population size for common and widespread breeding birds from national monitoring data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2011.623766","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"praveen2022","abstract":"Citizen-science driven exercises (e.g. bird surveys) and online platforms (e.g. eBird) provide voluminous data on bird occurrence. However, the semi-structured nature of their data collection makes it difficult to compare bird distribution across space and time. Bird atlases are based on standardized surveys and describe the distribution of bird species over a predefined region and have fewer biases, and thus are better suited for use in research. The recently concluded Kerala Bird Atlas (henceforth KBA) is Asia’s largest bird atlas in terms of geographical extent, sampling effort and species coverage. The entire state of Kerala was systematically surveyed twice a year during 2015–20 and over 0.3 million records of 380 species from 25,000 checklists were aggregated. The dataset was filtered and various metrics were estimated. A total of 915 cells were laid out for systematic surveys, of which 888 were surveyed in either or both the seasons – dry season (January–March) and wet season (July–September); 27 cells could not be surveyed in either of the seasons due to logistical constraints. However, this variation in sampling effort had a minimal effect on survey completeness. The slope of the species accumulation curve suggested nearcomplete species sampling in over 70% of the cells. After eliminating nocturnal and pelagic species, data from 361 species were analysed. Species count was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Species richness (count) and evenness were higher in the northern and central districts than in the southern districts. High elevation regions of the southern Western Ghats were the largest contiguous areas lacking sufficient sampling. We found that most of the endemics were concentrated in the Western Ghats, but threatened species were as likely to occur along the coasts as in the Ghats. The KBA dataset is a valuable resource for testing various ecological hypotheses and suggesting science-backed conservation measures. KBA model could be replicated for similar atlases in other states or biogeographic regions of India.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Praveen","given":"J."},{"family":"Nameer","given":"P.

  {"id":"freeman2022","abstract":"Species’ geographic ranges are limited by climate and species interactions. Climate is the prevailing explanation for why species live only within narrow elevational ranges in megadiverse biodiverse tropical mountains, but competition can also restrict species’ elevational ranges. We test contrasting predictions of these hypotheses by conducting a global comparative test of birds’ elevational range sizes within 31 montane regions, using more than 4.4 million citizen science records from eBird to define species’ elevational ranges in each region. We find strong support that competition, not climate, is the leading driver of narrow elevational ranges.

We compared record distribution according to human footprint, sampling behaviors, overall and conservation priority species composition during the strictest phase of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 to the same periods in 2015–2019. Overall participation in both platforms during the lockdown was high when compared to previous years, but records were concentrated on highly-transformed regions, had lower sampling efforts, and fewer species were recorded. For eBird, species composition was similar to that observed in previous years, and records of species of conservation concern declined in proportion to the decrease in overall species richness across samples. For iNaturalist, the species pool sampled each year remained too dissimilar for comparisons. Once differences in observer behaviors are accounted for, data from these platforms can be used in unplanned comparisons of relatively common species, in regions with high levels of human transformation, and at narrowly defined geographical contexts. To increase the potential of citizen science to monitor rarer species, more natural areas, or be used in large-scale analyses, we need to build and strengthen more diverse networks of observers that can further promote decentralization, democratization, and cost-effectiveness in biodiversity research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Sánchez-Clavijo","given":"Lina María"},{"family":"Martínez-Callejas","given":"Sindy Jineth"},{"family":"Acevedo-Charry","given":"Orlando"},{"family":"Diaz-Pulido","given":"Angélica"},{"family":"Gómez-Valencia","given":"Bibiana"},{"family":"Ocampo-Peñuela","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Ocampo","given":"David"},{"family":"Olaya-Rodríguez","given":"María Helena"},{"family":"Rey-Velasco","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Soto-Vargas","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Ochoa-Quintero","given":"Jose Manuel"}],"citation-key":"sanchez-clavijo2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109077","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"page":"109077","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Differential reporting of biodiversity in two citizen science platforms during COVID-19 lockdown in Colombia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721001294","volume":"256"},
  {"id":"behera2022","abstract":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes in human activity via extensive lockdowns worldwide. Large-scale shifts in human activities bestowed both positive and negative impacts on wildlife. Unforeseen reduction in the activities of people allowed wildlife to venture outside of forested areas to exploit newfound habitats and increase their diurnal activities. While on a negative note, a reduction in forest-related law enforcement led to substantial increase in illegal activities such as poaching. We conducted mammal surveys in forested and nearby farmland of a fragmented landscape under two distinct scenarios: pre-lockdown and lockdown. An increase in poaching activities observed during the lockdown period in our study area provided us an opportunity to investigate the impact of the lockdown on wildlife. Camera trapping data of four highly poached mammalian species, namely black-naped hare Lepus nigricollis, wild pig Sus scrofa, four-horned antelope Tetracerus quadricornis and leopard Panthera pardus were considered to investigate activity patterns and habitat use, to understand the effect of lockdown. The pre-lockdown period was used as a baseline to compare any changes in trends of activity patterns, habitat use and detection probabilities of targeted species. Species-specific changes in activity patterns of study species were observed, with an increment in daytime activity during lockdown. The results showed species-specific increase in the habitat use of study species during lockdown. Reduction in the detection probability of all study species was witnessed. This is the first study to highlight the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the responses of wildlife by considering the changes in their temporal and spatial use before and during lockdown. The knowledge gained on wildlife during reduced human mobility because of the pandemic aid in understanding the effect of human disturbances and developing future conservation strategies in the shared space, to manage both wildlife and humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Behera","given":"Asit K."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"P.

Using GPS data, we compared movements and road avoidance of 2300 terrestrial mammals (43 species) during the lockdowns to the same period in 2019. Individual responses were variable with no change in average movements or road avoidance behavior, likely due to variable lockdown conditions. However, under strict lockdowns 10-day 95th percentile displacements increased by 73%, suggesting increased landscape permeability. Animals’ 1-hour 95th percentile displacements declined by 12% and animals were 36% closer to roads in areas of high human footprint, indicating reduced avoidance during lockdowns.

  {"id":"barnett-howell2021","abstract":"Widespread social distancing and lockdowns of everyday activity have been the primary policy prescription across many countries throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their uniformity, these measures may be differentially valuable for different countries.We use a compartmental epidemiological model to project the spread of COVID-19 across policy scenarios in high- and low-income countries. We embed estimates of the welfare value of disease avoidance into the epidemiological projections to estimate the return to more stringent lockdown policies.Social distancing measures that ‘flatten the curve’ of the disease provide immense welfare value in upper-income countries. However, social distancing policies deliver significantly less value in lower-income countries that have younger populations, which are less vulnerable to COVID-19. Equally important, social distancing mandates a trade-off between disease risk and economic activity. Poorer people are less able to make those economic sacrifices.The epidemiological and welfare value of social distancing is smaller in lower-income countries and such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector often lack the resources and social protections that enable them to isolate themselves until the virus passes. By limiting these households’ ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnett-Howell","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Watson","given":"Oliver John"},{"family":"Mobarak","given":"Ahmed Mushfiq"}],"citation-key":"barnett-howell2021","container-title":"Transactions of The Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","container-title-short":"Transactions of The Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","DOI":"10.1093/trstmh/traa140","ISSN":"0035-9203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"page":"807-819","source":"Silverchair","title":"The benefits and costs of social distancing in high- and low-income countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa140","volume":"115"},

Sustaining individual protective behaviour is especially important in low-income and middle-income settings, where health systems have fewer resources and access to vaccination is limited. This study seeks to assess time trends in COVID-19 protective behaviour in India.\nDesign Nationally representative, panel-based, longitudinal study.\nSetting We conducted a panel survey of Indian households to understand how the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviours has changed over time. Our data span peaks and valleys of disease transmission over May–December 2020.\nParticipants Respondents included 3719 adults from 1766 Indian households enrolled in the Harmonised Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India.\nAnalysis We used ordinary least squares regression analysis to quantify time trends in protective behaviours.\nResults We find a 30.6 percentage point (95% CI (26.7 to 34.5); p<0.01) decline in protective behaviours related to social distancing over the observation period. Mask wearing and handwashing, in contrast, decreased by only 4.3 percentage points (95% CI (0.97 to 7.6); p<0.05) from a high base. Our conclusions are unchanged after adjusting for recorded COVID-19 caseload and nationwide COVID-19 containment policy; we also observe significant declines across socioeconomic strata spanning age, gender, education and urbanicity.\nConclusion We argue that these changes reflect, at least in part, ‘COVID-19 fatigue,’ where adherence to social distancing becomes more difficult over time irrespective of the surrounding disease environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Schaner","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Theys","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Angrisani","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Joyita"},{"family":"Khobragade","given":"Pranali Yogiraj"},{"family":"Petrosyan","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Arunika"},{"family":"Chien","given":"Sandy"},{"family":"Weerman","given":"Bas"},{"family":"Chakrawarty","given":"Avinash"},{"family":"Chatterjee","given":"Prasun"},{"family":"Madaan","given":"Nirupam"},{"family":"Bloom","given":"David"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jinkook"},{"family":"Dey","given":"Aparajit Ballav"}],"citation-key":"schaner2022","container-title":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058065","ISSN":"2044-6055, 2044-6055","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

  {"id":"brooks2022","abstract":"The African Bird Atlas Project (ABAP) is a citizen-science bird-monitoring programme that relies on a robust, repeatable protocol (BirdMap) and allows insights into the distributions of African birds and their conservation. The protocol involves collecting bird lists within spatial sampling units called pentads (5 × 5 minutes of latitude by longitude), in relation to survey effort. It is based on the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2), which is one of Africa’s largest citizen science projects, with over 600 thousand checklists, comprising ∼19 million bird locality records as of December 2021. SABAP2, which focuses on southern Africa, was initiated in 2007 and is ongoing. Both the Kenya Bird Map and the Nigerian Bird Atlas Project, initiated in 2013 and 2015, respectively, use this protocol. These projects have galvanised local birdwatching communities and allow for important comparisons across sub-Saharan African countries. The spatial scope of ABAP covers the entire African continent. Bird species lists are collected by citizen scientists within a pentad, with each list encompassing a minimum of 2 hours of active birding over a maximum of 5 days in the preferred ‘full-protocol’ format. Lists that do not meet the full protocol requirements are called ‘ad-hoc’. Species lists are mostly submitted to the SABAP2 database at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, by the third-party mobile phone application BirdLasser. Incoming data are vetted against existing records, with unusual records verified by Regional Atlas Committees. Data are open access via public websites. Distributional records can be downloaded for each species in the database, or site-specific species lists in various formats can be downloaded for pentads. Here, we introduce technical details of the database to inform researchers on how the data are gathered and curated. Data-access protocols are explained, with examples of data use given from the publication record.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brooks","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Rose","given":"Sanjo"},{"family":"Altwegg","given":"Res"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Alan TK"},{"family":"Nel","given":"Henk"},{"family":"Ottosson","given":"Ulf"},{"family":"Retief","given":"Ernst"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Chevonne"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Peter G"},{"family":"Shema","given":"Sidney"},{"family":"Tende","given":"Talatu"},{"family":"Underhill","given":"Les G"},{"family":"Thomson","given":"Robert L"}],"citation-key":"brooks2022","container-title":"Ostrich","DOI":"10.2989/00306525.2022.2125097","ISSN":"0030-6525","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"page":"223-232","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The African Bird Atlas Project: a description of the project and BirdMap data-collection protocol","title-short":"The African Bird Atlas Project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2022.2125097","volume":"93"},
  {"id":"rose2020a","abstract":"The COVID-19 lockdown has had a marked effect on citizen science projects, such as the Southern African Bird Atlas Project, SABAP2. With their mobility severely constrained, most citizen scientists in South Africa were not able to submit full protocol lists during the Alert Level 5 lockdown. There was a 70% decline in full protocol list submissions in April 2020, and only 20% of the number of pentads was surveyed, compared with the same period in the previous three years. The decline in ad hoc lists is also evident, with about a 50% decline in the number of lists submitted and 25% of the usual number of pentads. The number of citizen scientists submitting ad hoc lists only declined by about 15% in April, compared with previous years, indicating that volunteers were still eager to contribute to the atlas project, despite the challenging conditions. The BirdLasser ‘Lockdown Challenge’ further encouraged participation. Although the ability of citizen scientists to contribute full protocol lists to SABAP2 may have suffered, other projects with a scope more suited to lockdown thrived. The ‘Lockdown Garden Surveys’ instigated as part of a study of urban bird communities proved extremely successful, with 283 people regularly contributing point counts, many on a daily basis. The overwhelmingly positive response to initiatives like these indicates that the lockdown may have actually increased people’s desire to participate in citizen science. The pandemic also has put the spotlight on nature within cities, encouraging people to take a fresh look at their surrounding greenspaces. The accompanying boom in citizen science and interest in nature is something that must be harnessed going forward, and we hope this can be sustained despite the harsh economic climate exacerbated by the pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Rose","given":"Sanjo"},{"family":"Suri","given":"Jessleena"},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Peter G"}],"citation-key":"rose2020a","container-title":"Ostrich","DOI":"10.2989/00306525.2020.1783589","ISSN":"0030-6525","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,2]]},"page":"188-191","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"COVID-19 and citizen science: lessons learned from southern Africa","title-short":"COVID-19 and citizen science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2020.1783589","volume":"91"},
  {"id":"kittelberger2023","abstract":"Recent studies have revealed concerning declines in bird populations in Europe and other parts of the world. In understudied but biodiverse regions, especially those that are located along key migratory flyways, there is an unmet need to evaluate the status of resident and migratory birdlife for avian conservation ecology. This is especially urgent at a time when recent regional studies have highlighted the scale of the decline of the European and Palearctic avifauna. Rapidly growing community science datasets may help bridge the gaps in our understanding of long-term regional avifaunal trends. In this study, we used eBird data submitted by observers in Türkiye to undertake the first long-term assessment of the state of the country's birds from 2001 to 2022. We evaluated population trends based on presence-absence data of species to determine if any birds have significantly increased or decreased in the country so far this century. We provide a list of trends for 418 bird species that had large enough sample sizes of eBird observations from Türkiye, and highlight which species have significantly declined or increased. We found that 63 species have significantly declined in detection while 120 have significantly increased during the study period. Our findings provide a baseline for the future monitoring of Türkiye's birds and help contextualize population changes of birds in Türkiye against those occurring at the continental (Palearctic) scale. Additionally, we include movement classifications for all of the bird species in this study. We also provide a framework to effectively use eBird data to assess long-term avifaunal changes at the country-level in other understudied regions. Finally, we highlight ways in which eBirders in Türkiye and elsewhere can strengthen the quality and value of community ornithology data for population assessments and avian conservation ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kittelberger","given":"Kyle D."},{"family":"Tanner","given":"Colby J."},{"family":"Orton","given":"Nikolas D."},{"family":"Şekercioğlu","given":"Çağan Hakkı"}],"citation-key":"kittelberger2023","container-title":"Avian Research","container-title-short":"Avian Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.avrs.2023.100140","ISSN":"2053-7166","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"page":"100140","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The value of community science data to analyze long-term avian trends in understudied regions: The state of birds in Türkiye","title-short":"The value of community science data to analyze long-term avian trends in understudied regions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S205371662300066X","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"mckinley2017","abstract":"Citizen science has advanced science for hundreds of years, contributed to many peer-reviewed articles, and informed land management decisions and policies across the United States. Over the last 10years, citizen science has grown immensely in the United States and many other countries. Here, we show how citizen science is a powerful tool for tackling many of the challenges faced in the field of conservation biology. We describe the two interwoven paths by which citizen science can improve conservation efforts, natural resource management, and environmental protection. The first path includes building scientific knowledge, while the other path involves informing policy and encouraging public action. We explore how citizen science is currently used and describe the investments needed to create a citizen science program. We find that:1.Citizen science already contributes substantially to many domains of science, including conservation, natural resource, and environmental science. Citizen science informs natural resource management, environmental protection, and policymaking and fosters public input and engagement.2.Many types of projects can benefit from citizen science, but one must be careful to match the needs for science and public involvement with the right type of citizen science project and the right method of public participation.3.Citizen science is a rigorous process of scientific discovery, indistinguishable from conventional science apart from the participation of volunteers. When properly designed, carried out, and evaluated, citizen science can provide sound science, efficiently generate high-quality data, and help solve problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"McKinley","given":"Duncan C."},{"family":"Miller-Rushing","given":"Abe J."},{"family":"Ballard","given":"Heidi L."},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Hutch"},{"family":"Cook-Patton","given":"Susan C."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"French","given":"Rebecca A."},{"family":"Parrish","given":"Julia K."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tina B."},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Sean F."},{"family":"Shanley","given":"Lea A."},{"family":"Shirk","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Stepenuck","given":"Kristine F."},{"family":"Weltzin","given":"Jake F."},{"family":"Wiggins","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Boyle","given":"Owen D."},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Russell D."},{"family":"Chapin","given":"Stuart F."},{"family":"Hewitt","given":"David A."},{"family":"Preuss","given":"Peter W."},{"family":"Soukup","given":"Michael A."}],"citation-key":"mckinley2017","collection-title":"The role of citizen science in biological conservation","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2016.05.015","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,1]]},"page":"15-28","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Citizen science can improve conservation science, natural resource management, and environmental protection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716301963","volume":"208"},
  {"id":"menon2023","abstract":"Aim Elevational migration is a globally ubiquitous animal behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms that drive variation in elevational movement can help explain the evolution of this widespread animal behaviour and its role in shaping montane life history. We examine the role of thermal regime (the intra-annual variation in temperature experienced by a species), dispersal ability and diet in explaining the extent of elevational movements. Location Eastern and Western Himalayas. Time Period 2011–2022. Major Taxa Studied Birds. Methods We used community science data from eBird to acquire checklist-based observations of birds and used comprehensive data cleaning procedures and randomization tests to produce estimates of seasonal elevational shifts for 302 species of Himalayan birds. Using these data, we ran phylogenetic least squares regressions (PGLS) to test if the extent of elevational shift is driven by thermal regime, dispersal ability and diet. Results Most Himalayan birds (up to 65%) showed downslope shifts in the winter, although some (5%-10%) low elevation species shifted upslope. Elevational shift was negatively associated with a species' thermal regime. Species that showed the greatest elevational shifts in both eastern and western Himalayas moved within the narrowest intra-annual temperature regimes, but did not match their breeding range temperatures as closely as possible. Diet influenced elevational shift in both eastern and western Himalayas, while dispersal ability did not drive elevational shifts. Main Conclusions Species that show the biggest elevational shifts track thermal regimes most closely. However, in addition to tracking thermal regimes, diet and potentially habitat availability/preferences may drive seasonal elevational shifts. Our results show convergent evolution of elevational shifts across clades. Low elevation habitats are important not only for conserving low elevation birds but also for conserving wintering sites of most high elevation breeders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Menon","given":"Tarun"},{"family":"Ramesh","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Barve","given":"Sahas"}],"citation-key":"menon2023","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.13761","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","page":"2111-2121","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Himalayan birds that show the greatest elevational shifts remain within the narrowest thermal regimes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.13761","volume":"32"},

Under higher human activity, mammals were less active in undeveloped areas but unexpectedly more active in developed areas while exhibiting greater nocturnality.

  {"id":"thrikkadeeri2024","abstract":"Many parts of the world lack the large and coordinated volunteer networks required for systematic monitoring of bird populations. In these regions, citizen science programs offer an alternative with their semi-structured data, but the utility of these data is contingent on how, where, and how comparably birdwatchers watch birds, year on year. Trends inferred from the data can be confounded during years when birdwatchers may behave differently, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. We wanted to ascertain how the data uploaded from India to one such citizen science platform, eBird, were impacted by this deadly global pandemic. To understand whether eBird data from the pandemic years in India are comparable to data from adjacent years, we explored several characteristics of the data, such as how often people watched birds in groups or at public locations, at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We found that the volume of data generated increased during the pandemic years 2020–2021 compared to 2019. Data characteristics changed largely only during the peak pandemic months (April–May 2020 and April–May 2021) associated with high fatality rates and strict lockdowns. These changes in data characteristics (e.g., greater site fidelity and less group birding) were possibly due to the decreased human mobility and social interaction in these periods. The data from the remainder of these restrictive years remained similar to those of the adjacent years, thereby reducing the impact of the aberrant peak months on any annual inference. Our findings show that birdwatchers in India as contributors to citizen science rapidly returned to their pre-pandemic behavior, and that the effects of the pandemic on birdwatching effort and birdwatcher behavior are scale- and context-dependent. In summary, eBird data from the pandemic years in India remain useful for abundance trend estimation and similar large-scale applications, but will benefit from preliminary data quality checks when utilized at a fine scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Thrikkadeeri","given":"Karthik"},{"family":"Viswanathan","given":"Ashwin"}],"citation-key":"thrikkadeeri2024","container-title":"Ornithological Applications","container-title-short":"Ornithological Applications","DOI":"10.1093/ornithapp/duae024","ISSN":"0010-5422","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,11]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"duae024","source":"Silverchair","title":"Despite short-lived changes, COVID-19 pandemic had minimal large-scale impact on citizen science participation in India","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ornithapp/duae024"}
