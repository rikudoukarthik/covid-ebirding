# Introduction

Like the bubonic plague, influenza, smallpox and even cholera, COVID-19 is a deadly infectious disease that has resulted in a widespread pandemic. It is the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century and one of the deadliest in human history, with a death toll of more than 5.5 million [around 0.07% of the global population; Worldometer -@worldometer2022; Wikipedia -@wikipedia2022]. Unsurprisingly, governments across the world have taken various precautionary and preventive measures, and have implemented various restrictions such as nation- or state-wide lockdowns and curfews, quarantines and self-isolation, and shutting down of non-essential public services and activities. In such unprecedented and disruptive times, the shortcomings of traditional methods of data collection for scientific research---which are especially contingent on human circumstances---become glaringly obvious and hamper progress. However, many of these pitfalls do not apply as strongly to (and hence can be overcome by using) large-scale, crowdsourced, open access data on a wide variety of metrics, from human traffic levels to species occurrence [@bates2020]. Citizen science today is a research technique that engages volunteers from the general public---most of whom are not trained as scientists---in collecting and/or analysing and interpreting data as part of a scientific enquiry [@silvertown2009]. Most importantly, citizen science programmes facilitate attempts at answering large-scale questions that are otherwise not feasible [@macphail2020].

The direct distress of the pandemic, together with the various preventive measures implemented to control it, has had severe impacts on general health and well-being of the public---on not just physical but also psychological and social facets. Thus, the pandemic has also required people to actively monitor and improve their health. Leisure and recreation activities play a vital role in improving physical and mental health, and outdoor rather than indoor activities are better for restoring attention [@weng2014]. Birdwatching (hereafter birding) is a nature-based recreation activity that is enjoyed by people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Birders frequently make "checklists" of the bird species they observe in different birding sessions, often with accurate counts. By volunteering the data that is thus inherently collected during participation in the activity, numerous birders---from trained researchers to experienced birders to laypersons---are able to contribute to the scientific study of birds. eBird [@sullivan2014] is a citizen science project that gathers and stores data from birders all over the world, enabling large-scale robust scientific analysis and output [@kelling2019]. eBird data has proved very useful in better understanding the ecology of birds, species ranges [e.g., @sreekumar2021; @sinnott2021], migration [e.g., @aoki2021; @youngflesh2021], behaviour [e.g., @alaniz2020; @winger2019], morphology [e.g., `Menon et al. 2022`; @vrettos2021] and conservation action [@sullivan2017; @soib2020; @ruiz-gutierrez2021]. [See `Patankar et al. 2022 in press` for a list of scientific outputs using eBird from India.]

The data from citizen science projects such as eBird thus become all the more important in times like the current pandemic, when many traditional research programmes are brought to a halt. For instance, questions relating to the influence of anthropogenic factors on organisms, a recent and interesting avenue for biological research, are usually unanswered because of the difficulty in, even hypothetically, nullifying the human footprint. But the pandemic, arriving amidst this latest period of intense and extremely rapid expansion of human activity (and thereby modification of the environment), offers an invaluable opportunity to study exactly these questions. In particular, the strict lockdowns enforced in order to control the pandemic are periods of greatly reduced human activity and allow us to study ecological release in the context of human pressure, and to identify organisms that are most affected and vulnerable to these stresses [@rutz2020; see also @bates2020]. Currently however, systematic studies following traditional protocols are mostly not feasible, whereas many citizen science programmes continue to operate.

Birds are a great study group for these questions, as they have been researched extensively and are also easier to observe than others. Additionally, their responses are expected to be highly insightful, as they are closely linked to human activity: not only do anthropogenic factors affect habitat availability, suitability, survival and fitness, etc., but many of their behavioural traits are also directly affected by human activity (e.g., song amplitude and frequency, time of vocal activity, etc.). Indeed, during the period of most stringent restrictions in USA, although a few species showed a decline, most increased in abundance in areas that saw a decrease in human activity [@schrimpf2021]. In contrast, species tightly linked to human presence and activity like the Feral Pigeon showed lower abundances [@soh2021].

There is also recent proof that behavioural traits can change rapidly in response to new changes in environmental conditions: @derryberry2020 showed that as traffic noise levels in urban areas during the lockdown decreased significantly, birds quickly adapted and optimised their vocalisation by producing higher performance songs at lower amplitudes, maximising communication distance and salience. Elsewhere, @gordo2021 disentangled probability of occurrence from detectability of birds, and found that the latter increased in urban areas throughout the day, especially during the early hours, evidencing phenotypic plasticity. Notably however, they also found that in urban areas the lockdown did not result in higher occurrence rates of birds than before. In the few cases of marginal increases, the authors attribute this instead to more intensive and homogenous urban sampling during the lockdown (whereas prior to the pandemic urban sampling would have included urban parks or suburbs).

Although the openness, inclusivity, size and scale of such citizen science programmes often compensate for the bureaucratic, logistical and practical challenges of traditional data collection protocols, a major shortcoming is the fundamental unsystematic nature of citizen science data [see @pocock2017]. As the observers decide when, where and for how long to make observations, the sampling processes are bound to vary temporally as well as spatially. And while these less structured projects have not ceased activity during the pandemic, the characteristics of the data collected (such as proportion of urban observations) are likely to have changed substantially due to the various restrictions imposed.

First of all, the quantity of data collected itself could have decreased, owing to various physical and travel restrictions [e.g., @kishimoto2021]. On the other hand, there was an increased desire in people to connect with the natural world [e.g., @marsh2021], and even active promotion and encouragement of nature-related activities such as birding [e.g., @birdcountindia2020], which could have generated more data. This has been found to be the case with the citizen science programme iNaturalist [@basile2021]. The spatial coverage and evenness of the data could have decreased due to restricted mobility, with observations being clustered in urbanised locations [@vardi2021], thus reducing its overall informational value [@zhang2020]. But conversely, the pandemic restrictions could have reduced the tendency for birders to "flock" to birding hotspots (irrespective of the urban-rural dichotomy), and instead forced them to upload observations from around their erstwhile under-surveyed neighbourhoods, resulting in less clustering [@kishimoto2021]. The overall diversity of habitats surveyed is likely to have decreased though, as is the proportion of observations using travelling protocols. Moreover, the temporal distribution of observations during the pandemic could be different from that of prior years.

Indeed, @randler2020 found that the pandemic-induced lockdown caused significant changes in spatial, temporal, social, demographic and nation-linked aspects of birding. On the other hand, @hochachka2021 found that alteration in birder behaviour during the month-long lockdown, while present, was not as substantial as expected from the magnitude of change to daily life, and that biases were seen mostly in habitat representation and observer effort. The four political units they studied all showed different patterns, emphasising the need to consider regional differences. However, the study focused on a single month, so how exactly these results will translate to patterns at the broader temporal scale is unanswered. Most studies looking at large-scale temporal trends [e.g., @soib2020] would compare multiple years and geographical regions.

In the present study, we focus on the immediate imperative of ascertaining---in the Indian context---exactly how characteristics of eBird data have been affected by the pandemic. We also outline the consequences of the pandemic on birds and the birding community. Further, we explore changes to the inferences that can be drawn when using this pandemic data together with "normal" data. Lastly, we propose guidelines for making the most of the available data while accounting appropriately for pandemic-driven biases and deviations from pre-COVID normals.

# Methods

## Data preparation

We used the "relMay-2022" version of the publicly available [eBird Basic Dataset (EBD)](https://ebird.org/data/download/ebd) for India, containing all data uploaded until 31 May 2022 (downloaded on 15 June 2022; follows taxonomy in `Clements et al. (2018)`). We combined [sensitive species data](https://ebird.org/india/news/ebird-sensitive-species/), which is not included in the public download, after requesting separately from eBird. Before analysis, we applied a set of filters to standardise the dataset, so as to prevent any extreme and outlying cases from skewing patterns `cite Sullivan Best practices?.`

First, we filtered the dataset for "complete checklists", in which observers report all the birds they see or hear. Next, we filtered the data for our timeline of interest. The migratory cycle in India starts in June of one calendar year and ends in May of the next, and this time frame is thus deemed more appropriate than a calendar year. Therefore, all analyses presented in this study use "migratory year" as a unit time period and we analysed data over a period of four migratory years, from 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2022, classifying each month into one of four COVID categories `fig1`. We consider a relatively fine temporal scale of months in order to account for within-year variations in bird and birder behaviour. Moreover, in India severe COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns were limited to a few months in 2020 and 2021 `ref`, and this scale allows us to consider these patterns separately from patterns in other months of the "pandemic years".

We then removed data from group accounts, which are eBird accounts with which multiple existing eBirders share their lists to track aggregate summaries. Such accounts are commonly used during specific events or surveys, and need to be removed from analyses of observer-related metrics. Next, we applied a nocturnal filter to remove observations made between 8pm and 4am (nocturnal birding is very different from diurnal birding), a pelagic filter to remove observations made from beyond the shoreline of the country, and finally a set of effort filters to remove observations made with extreme values of effort: checklists that are too short (less than three minutes long, or reporting three or fewer species without information on duration, or reporting three or fewer species at a rate lower than two species per hour), and travelling checklists that are too fast (following "Traveling" protocol and travelling faster than 20 kmph or covering a distance greater than 50 km). These lists with extreme effort are not considered to be "truly complete" checklists. The dataset at this stage was used in analyses of observer-level metrics, while for other metrics a final filter was added: in instances of group birding where each participant eBirder owns a copy of the checklist, duplicate records/checklists were removed by filtering out non-unique combinations of group birding event (column "GROUP.IDENTIFIER") and bird species (column "COMMON.NAME").

We used remote sensing data to divide the country into urban and non-urban (rural) areas. For this, we downloaded the MODIS Land Cover Type Product (MCD12Q1) `MODIS CITATION` that includes several science datasets (SDSs) mapping global land cover at a 500 m resolution. Although this comes at an annual time step, we used data from the single time point, `May 2022`. The tiled MODIS data was downloaded using the `getModis()` function in the `luna` (`cite luna`) package and saved as individual .tif files, which were then merged into a single raster.

After cropping and masking to the country's administrative boundary shapefile, the MODIS land cover categories in the raster were reclassified: category 13, "urban and built-up lands" was considered "urban", and all other categories were considered "non-urban". We didn't use the MODIS data at 500 m × 500 m resolution because the location information in eBird data, despite being precise, is not very accurate at small grain sizes (due to the very nature of eBird data where sampling often occurs over a distance). So, finally we aggregated the raster to a resolution of 2 km × 2 km which was deemed most appropriate.

## Analysis of data quantity and quality

We explored the presence of effects of the pandemic on eBird data from India by analysing changes in data quantity and quality with the pandemic. To this end, we devised a suite of metrics `table1` that help gauge various aspects of data quantity and quality. These metrics were compared at the monthly level across our years of interest (between the different COVID categories), i.e., the metrics were calculated per month, across the four years.

### Metrics of birdwatcher behaviour

1.  *Group birding* (observer-level): Were there fewer instances of group birding during the pandemic? For this, we calculated the proportion of an observer's total submitted lists that were instances of group birding, defined as birding events with three or more observers.

2.  *Site fidelity* (observer-level): Given the various restrictions on movement and travel, did birdwatchers show higher site fidelity during the pandemic? In other words, were their birding activities restricted more to certain sites than previously? Here, we considered each of `XX` 25 km × 25 km grid cells across the country as being a unique "site", and calculated the number of such unique sites visited by a birder.

3.  *Birding time* (observer-level): Did birders overall spend less time birding during the pandemic? We calculated total birding time by summing observation durations across all checklists submitted by an observer.

4.  *Hotspot birding*: eBird "hotspots" are public birding locations demarcated by eBird users to aggregate and display data from multiple birders [@zotero-913]. Given the overall decline in public/social interactions during the pandemic, did people also tend to avoid birding in eBird hotspots? We calculated, out of total submitted lists, the proportion that was from eBird hotspots.

5.  *Birding protocol*: "Traveling" and "Stationary" are the two most commonly followed protocols in eBird observations. Considering the restrictions on movement during the pandemic, we wondered whether birders also avoided making travelling lists, instead preferring stationary lists from their residences. We calculated, out of total submitted lists, the proportion that used the "Traveling" protocol.

6.  *Birding distance*: Among the observations that followed the "Traveling" protocol, we asked whether travelling distance were overall shorter during the pandemic. Here, we simply used the distance travelled, measured as part of the checklist-level effort metadata.

7.  *List duration*: Did eBird checklists become shorter in duration during the pandemic? Rather than calculating the overall time spent birding (as in 3), we considered effort at the checklist level and used checklist duration from the effort metadata.

8.  *List length*: List length is defined as the total number of species observed in a checklist. Using this metric which is known to be a better predictor of effort than distance or duration `Viswanathan 2023`, we approached from a different angle the question of whether checklists became shorter during the pandemic.

9.  *Temporal spread*: Did the pandemic bring a change in when birders chose to observe birds? We looked at how checklists were distributed proportionally over two temporal scales: across the seven days of a week, and across the twenty-four hours of a day (although in the latter case our dataset was truncated due to our nocturnal filter).

`Media and new birders also? Maybe can keep to supplementary.`

### Spatial coverage

A decrease in overall coverage of the data from the pandemic was a major concern, due to the restrictions on travel. We calculated the proportion of 25 km × 25 km grid cells across the country that were covered in each time period. A threshold of 10 checklists (per month per year) was set, above which cells were considered "covered".

### Spatial spread

Did the pandemic create spatial clusters of positive or negative change in birding activity across grid cells in the country, or was birding relatively uniformly spread out? For each grid cell, we calculated proportional change in birding activity (number of lists submitted) for transition periods ("before" to "during" and "during" to "after", where "during" was an aggregate of "During_2020" and "During_2021").

`different method for statistical validation of this (TBD)`

### Urban bias

A majority of eBird users in general are urban-dwelling. With the pandemic limiting people's movements, was birding concentrated much more strongly in urban areas during the pandemic than otherwise? We classified each checklist as urban or non-urban by extracting the land cover class from the modified MODIS raster for the checklist location defined by its geographical coordinates in the effort metadata. Then, back at the 25 km × 25 km grid cell level, we calculated the proportion of lists in each cell that were urban.

### Statistical validation

Unless otherwise mentioned, the above analyses were first done using exploratory visualisations, following which emerging patterns were validated using simple confidence calculations or bootstrap validation in some cases (see `Supplementary Materials`). Finally, after the metrics and analysis approaches were deemed meaningful, they were tested statistically using Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) `reference?`. For the observer-level metrics (group birding, site fidelity, and birding time), observer identity was used as the random effect, whereas spatial identity defined by grid cell ID was used as the random effect for all other models. There was no model run for temporal spread due to it being a visual metric and its model specifications being very different from those of other metrics. The metric of birding distance was tested using an LMM (not GLMM), with the effort distance response variable log-transformed (natural) to ensure normality. The various models and their specifications are listed in `table1`.

diagnostics

All the metrics with their standard errors were first calculated at the state level, then propagated to the national level (errors propagated following `errorpropagation`), in order to highlight the high variability across scales, regions, governments, etc. The four states selected to highlight nuances were Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Assam; these have relatively high eBirding activity, but also differ in stage and culture of the birding community as well as in local governance, policy and general public perspective.

## Analysis of bird species reporting

To ascertain whether any of the changes in data quantity and quality during the pandemic impacted bird species reporting, or whether reporting changed at all due to any other factor, we conducted two major analyses involving two sets of commonly and easily observed bird species, one set of species common in human-dominated (urban) areas and the other uncommon in urban areas. Since not all species are widespread and equally abundant in different parts of the country, there were a few replacements in the species sets for different regions. Overall, we considered `xx` species in this study, of which `yy` were classified as "urban" and `zz` as "rural". Details of the region-wise species sets are provided in `table2`.

### Overall reporting patterns

In each of the four states analysed in our study, we also selected one of their large metropolitan (urban) cities. For every species in the corresponding regional species set, we visualised individual species reporting patterns at two temporal (months, migratory years) and spatial (cities, state) scales. We then pooled data from all urban and all rural species, and analysed and statistically tested whether overall species reporting patterns at the large scale (migratory years & state) were affected by the pandemic. This gave us an idea of how urban and rural species idiosyncratically differed in terms of general reporting, how species reporting varied across urban areas and how this averaged out over a large spatial scale, and how species reporting varied over the course of a year and how this variation was expressed at the large temporal scale. Finally, we compared the overall species reporting patterns during only the months of April and May with those during the other`/all` months of the year, to help determine whether the effects of the pandemic on species reporting were restricted to the strict lockdown period. Kamrup Metropolitan, the metropolitan capital of the state of Assam, did not have sufficient data for visualisation of month-level patterns, so this combination was dropped.

`table2`

### Reporting patterns with consistent effort

The quality of citizen science data is contingent on observer effort; it is possible for changes in observer effort to produce artefactual changes in metrics such as reporting frequency. Given the existence of biases in effort driven by birder behaviour, it then becomes difficult to make inferences from such data. Hence, in order to ensure that the patterns visible in overall bird species reporting at the large scale are not driven by changes in data quantity and quality, we conducted a similar analysis using data only from "prolific" birders having consistent effort. An eBirder was considered "prolific" if they had submitted, from a single location, at least 800 qualifying checklists (following `section data preparation`) over the course of the four years being analysed (sufficient effort), as well as a minimum of 15 qualifying checklists per month in at least ten months of a year in all four years of the study (consistent effort). Since the observer remains constant, and the observer being sufficiently experienced (as inferred from their prolificacy), we assume that detectability of birds in the location also remains similar over the years. Hence, this analysis allows us to make some reasonable conclusion regarding actual behavioural changes in birds.

From the set of species analysed in the previous section, we determined those to be analysed for each prolific birder by first filtering out uncommon species, retaining only those with an overall reporting frequency (over the entire study period) of at least 15%. Next, from the set of species that passed the first filter, we removed those that appeared in only one location (i.e., was observed by only one prolific birder), since a factor with only one level cannot be used as a random effect in a GLMM. Finally, if any prolific birder (their location) was left with species falling in less than two species categories (i.e., urban and rural) after the filters, they were excluded from the analysis.

### Statistical validation

SEs

prolific:

model run separately for each location, and species variables included in model . Due to strikingly obvious differences in birding conditions between the lockdown and non-lockdown periods (and due to large differences in results from both approaches), we ran three separate models: one for the months of April and May, one for the other ten months, and one for all twelve months together.
