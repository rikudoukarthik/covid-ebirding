# Introduction

Like the bubonic plague, influenza, smallpox and even cholera, COVID-19 is a deadly infectious disease that has resulted in a widespread pandemic. It is the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century and one of the deadliest in human history, with a death toll of more than 5.5 million [around 0.07% of the global population; Worldometer -@worldometer2022; Wikipedia -@wikipedia2022]. Unsurprisingly, governments across the world had taken various precautionary and preventive measures, and had implemented various restrictions such as nation- or state-wide lockdowns and curfews, quarantines and self-isolation, and shutting down of non-essential public services and activities. In such unprecedented and disruptive times, the shortcomings of traditional methods of data collection for scientific research---which are especially contingent on human circumstances---have become glaringly obvious and have hampered progress in the field. However, many of these pitfalls do not apply as strongly to (and hence can be overcome by using) large-scale, crowdsourced, open access data on a wide variety of metrics, from human traffic levels to species occurrence [@bates2020]. Citizen science today is a research technique that engages volunteers from the general public---most of whom are not trained as scientists---in collecting and/or analysing and interpreting data as part of a scientific enquiry [@silvertown2009]. Most importantly, citizen science programmes facilitate attempts at answering large-scale questions that are otherwise not feasible [@macphail2020].

The direct distress of the pandemic, together with the various preventive measures implemented to control it, has had severe impacts on general health and well-being of the public---on not just physical but also psychological and social facets. Thus, the pandemic has also required people to actively monitor and improve their health. Leisure and recreation activities play a vital role in improving physical and mental health, and outdoor rather than indoor activities are better for restoring attention [@weng2014]. Birdwatching (hereafter birding) is a nature-based recreation activity that is enjoyed by people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Birders frequently make "checklists" of the bird species they observe in different birding sessions, often with accurate counts. By volunteering the data that is thus inherently collected during participation in the activity, numerous birders---from trained researchers to experienced birders to laypersons---are able to contribute to the scientific study of birds. eBird [@sullivan2014] is a citizen science project that gathers and stores data from birders all over the world, enabling large-scale robust scientific analysis and output [@kelling2019]. eBird data has proved very useful in better understanding the ecology of birds, species ranges [e.g., @sreekumar2021; @sinnott2021], migration [e.g., @aoki2021; @youngflesh2021], behaviour [e.g., @alaniz2020; @winger2019], morphology [e.g., @menon2022; @vrettos2021] and conservation action [@sullivan2017; @soib2020; @ruiz-gutierrez2021]. [See `Patankar et al. 2022 in press` for a list of scientific outputs using eBird from India.]

The data from citizen science projects such as eBird thus become all the more important in times like the COVID-19 pandemic, when many traditional research programmes are brought to a halt. For instance, questions relating to the influence of anthropogenic factors on organisms, a recent and interesting avenue for biological research, are usually unanswered because of the difficulty in, even hypothetically, nullifying the human footprint. But the pandemic, arriving amidst this latest period of intense and extremely rapid expansion of human activity (and thereby modification of the environment), offers an invaluable opportunity to study exactly these questions. In particular, the strict lockdowns enforced in order to control the pandemic are periods of greatly reduced human activity and allow us to study ecological release in the context of human pressure, and to identify organisms that are most affected and vulnerable to these stresses [@rutz2020; see also @bates2020]. Currently however, systematic studies following traditional protocols are mostly not feasible, whereas many citizen science programmes continue to operate.

Although the openness, inclusivity, size and scale of such citizen science programmes often compensate for the bureaucratic, logistical and practical challenges of traditional data collection protocols, a major shortcoming is the fundamental unsystematic nature of citizen science data [see @pocock2017]. As the observers decide when, where and for how long to make observations, the sampling processes are bound to vary temporally as well as spatially. And while these less structured projects have not ceased activity during the pandemic, the characteristics of the data collected (such as proportion of urban observations) are likely to have changed substantially due to the various restrictions imposed.

First of all, the quantity of data collected itself could on one hand have decreased, owing to various physical and travel restrictions [e.g., @kishimoto2021]. On the other hand, there was an increased desire in people to connect with the natural world [e.g., @marsh2021], and even active promotion and encouragement of nature-related activities such as birding [e.g., @birdcountindia2020], which could have generated more data. This has been found to be the case with the citizen science programme iNaturalist [@basile2021]. Additionally, the spatial coverage and evenness of the data could have decreased due to restricted mobility, with observations being clustered in urbanised locations [@vardi2021], thus reducing its overall informational value [@zhang2020]. But conversely, the pandemic restrictions could have reduced the tendency for birders to "flock" to birding hotspots (irrespective of the urban-rural dichotomy), and instead forced them to upload observations from around their erstwhile under-surveyed neighbourhoods, resulting in less clustering [@kishimoto2021]. The overall diversity of habitats surveyed is likely to have decreased though, as is the proportion of observations using travelling protocols. Moreover, the temporal distribution of observations during the pandemic could be different from that of prior years.

Indeed, @randler2020 found that the pandemic-induced lockdown caused significant changes in spatial, temporal, social, demographic and nation-linked aspects of birding. On the other hand, @hochachka2021 found that alteration in birder behaviour during the month-long lockdown, while present, was not as substantial as expected from the magnitude of change to daily life, and that biases were seen mostly in habitat representation and observer effort. The four political units they studied all showed different patterns, emphasising the need to consider regional differences. However, the study focused on a single month, so how exactly these results will translate to patterns at the broader temporal scale is unanswered. Most studies looking at large-scale temporal trends [e.g., @soib2020] would compare multiple years and geographical regions.

In the present study, we focus on the immediate imperative of ascertaining---in the Indian context---exactly how characteristics of eBird data have been affected by the pandemic. We also outline the consequences of the pandemic on the birding community and on some Indian birds. Further, we explore changes to the inferences that can be drawn when using this pandemic data together with "normal" data. Lastly, we propose guidelines for making the most of the available data while accounting appropriately for pandemic-driven biases and deviations from pre-COVID normals.

# Methods

## Data preparation

We used the "relMay-2022" version of the publicly available [eBird Basic Dataset (EBD)](https://ebird.org/data/download/ebd) for India, containing all data uploaded until 31 May 2022 [downloaded on 15 June 2022; follows taxonomy in @clements2019]. We combined [sensitive species data](https://ebird.org/india/news/ebird-sensitive-species/), which is not included in the public download, after requesting separately from eBird. Before analysis, we applied a set of filters to standardise the dataset, so as to prevent any extreme and outlying cases from skewing patterns.

First, we filtered the dataset for "complete checklists", in which observers report all the birds they see or hear. Next, we filtered the data for our timeline of interest. The migratory cycle in India starts in June of one calendar year and ends in May of the next, and this time frame is thus deemed more appropriate than a calendar year. Therefore, all analyses presented in this study use "migratory year" as a unit time period and we analysed data over a period of four migratory years, from 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2022 `fig1`. We consider a relatively fine temporal scale of months in order to account for within-year variations in bird and birder behaviour. Moreover, in India severe COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns were limited to a few months in 2020 and 2021 `ref`, and this scale allows us to consider these patterns separately from patterns in other months of the "pandemic years" (the migratory years 2019 and 2020, coded as "DUR"; 2018 and 2021 coded as "BEF" and "AFT" respectively).

We then removed data from group accounts, which are eBird accounts with which multiple existing eBirders share their lists to track aggregate summaries. Such accounts are commonly used during specific events or surveys, and need to be removed from analyses of observer-related metrics. Next, we applied a nocturnal filter to remove observations made between 8pm and 4am (nocturnal birding is very different from diurnal birding), a pelagic filter to remove observations made from beyond the shoreline of the country, and finally a set of effort filters to remove observations made with extreme values of effort: checklists that are too short (less than three minutes long, or reporting three or fewer species without information on duration, or reporting three or fewer species at a rate lower than two species per hour), and travelling checklists that are too fast (following "Traveling" protocol and travelling faster than 20 kmph or covering a distance greater than 50 km). These lists with extreme effort are not considered to be "truly complete" checklists. The dataset at this stage was used in analyses of observer-level metrics (see details below), while for non-observer-level data metrics and metrics of bird reporting, a final filter was added: in instances of group birding where each participant eBirder owns a copy of the checklist, duplicate records/checklists were removed by filtering out non-unique combinations of group birding event (column "GROUP.IDENTIFIER") and bird species (column "COMMON.NAME"). The checklists that passed these criteria are hereafter referred to as "qualifying checklists".

We gridded the spatial extent of the country into 25 km × 25 km cells and used the latitude-longitude information associated with each of these qualifying checklists to place them in corresponding grid cells. In addition, we used remote sensing data to divide the country into urban and non-urban (rural) areas. For this, we downloaded the MODIS Land Cover Type Product [MCD12Q1; @friedl2019] that includes several science datasets (SDSs) mapping global land cover at a 500 m resolution. Although this comes at an annual time step, we used data from the single time point, 31 December 2021. The tiled MODIS data was downloaded using the `getModis()` function in the `luna` (`cite luna`) package and saved as individual .tif files, which were then merged into a single raster. After cropping and masking to the country's administrative boundary shapefile, the MODIS land cover categories in the raster were reclassified: category 13, "urban and built-up lands" was considered "urban", and all other categories were considered "non-urban". We didn't use the MODIS data at 500 m × 500 m resolution because the location information in eBird data, despite being precise, is not very accurate at small grain sizes (due to the very nature of eBird data where sampling often occurs over a distance). So, finally we aggregated the raster to a resolution of 2 km × 2 km which was deemed most appropriate, then classified each qualifying checklist in the dataset as urban or non-urban by extracting the land cover class from the modified MODIS raster, again using the latitude-longitude information.

## Analysis of data quantity and quality

We explored the presence of effects of the pandemic on eBird data from India by analysing changes in data quantity and quality with the pandemic. To this end, we devised a suite of metrics `table1` that help gauge various aspects of data quantity and quality. These metrics were compared at the monthly level across our years of interest, i.e., the metrics were calculated per month, across the four years. Moreover, all the metrics except for spatial spread and temporal spread `(urban bias also?)` were analysed at two spatial scales: for the whole country and for each of four states. The four states we considered in our study in order to highlight nuances were Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Assam. These states have relatively high eBirding activity and cover different regions of the country, but also differ in stage and culture of the birding community as well as in local governance, policy and general public perspective.

### Metrics of birdwatcher behaviour

1.  *Group birding* (observer-level): Were there fewer instances of group birding during the pandemic? For this, we calculated the proportion of an observer's total submitted qualifying lists that were instances of group birding, defined as birding events with three or more observers.

2.  *Site fidelity* (observer-level): Given the various restrictions on movement and travel, did birdwatchers show higher site fidelity during the pandemic? In other words, were their birding activities restricted more to certain sites than previously? Here, we considered each of `XX` 25 km × 25 km grid cells across the country as being a unique "site", and calculated the number of such unique sites visited by a birder.

3.  *Birding time* (observer-level): Did birders overall spend less time birding during the pandemic? We calculated total birding time by summing observation durations across all qualifying checklists submitted by an observer.

4.  *Hotspot birding*: eBird "hotspots" are public birding locations demarcated by eBird users to aggregate and display data from multiple birders [@ebird2022]. Given the overall decline in public/social interactions during the pandemic, did people also tend to avoid birding in eBird hotspots? We calculated, out of total submitted qualifying lists, the proportion that was from eBird hotspots.

5.  *Birding protocol*: "Traveling" and "Stationary" are the two most commonly followed protocols in eBird observations. Considering the restrictions on movement during the pandemic, we wondered whether birders also avoided making travelling lists, instead preferring stationary lists from their residences. We calculated, out of total submitted qualifying lists, the proportion that used the "Traveling" protocol.

6.  *Birding distance*: Among the observations that followed the "Traveling" protocol, we asked whether travelling distance were overall shorter during the pandemic. Here, we simply used the distance travelled, measured as part of the checklist-level effort metadata.

7.  *List duration*: Did eBird checklists become shorter in duration during the pandemic? Rather than calculating the overall time spent birding (as in 3), we considered effort at the checklist level and used checklist duration from the effort metadata.

8.  *List length*: List length is defined as the total number of species observed in a checklist. This metric which is known to be a better predictor of effort than distance or duration (Viswanathan in press), and we used it to answer, from a different angle, the question of whether checklists became shorter during the pandemic.

9.  *Temporal spread*: Did the pandemic bring a change in when birders chose to observe birds? We looked at how checklists were distributed proportionally over two temporal scales: across the seven days of a week, and across the twenty-four hours of a day (although in the latter case our dataset was truncated due to our nocturnal filter).

### Urban bias

A majority of eBird users in general are urban-dwelling. With the pandemic limiting people's movements, was birding concentrated much more strongly in urban areas during the pandemic than otherwise? At the 25 km × 25 km grid cell level, we calculated the proportion of lists in each cell that were urban.

### Spatial coverage

A decrease in overall coverage of the data from the pandemic was a major concern, due to the restrictions on travel. We calculated the proportion of 25 km × 25 km grid cells across the country that were covered in each time period. The information threshold for a grid cell to be considered "covered" was set at 5 qualifying checklists (per month per year).

### Spatial spread

Did the pandemic create spatial clusters of positive or negative change in birding activity across grid cells in the country, or were changes in birding (if any) relatively uniformly spread out? For each grid cell, we calculated proportional change in birding activity (number of qualifying lists submitted) for transition periods ("BEF" to "DUR" and "DUR" to "AFT", where "DUR" was an aggregate of migratory years 2019 and 2020). `If this metric not calculated for every month, mention explicitly? See S4 for details on how this metric was calculated and interpreted.`

### Statistical validation

For all metrics except spatial spread, unless otherwise mentioned, the above analyses were first done using exploratory visualisations, following which emerging patterns were validated using simple confidence calculations or bootstrap validation in some cases (see `S1.1`). Finally, after the metrics and analysis approaches were deemed meaningful, they were tested statistically using Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). For the observer-level metrics (group birding, site fidelity, and birding time), observer identity was used as the random effect, whereas spatial identity defined by grid cell ID was used as the random effect for all other models `(nested within district for the urban bias model??; table1)`. All GLMMs were fit with binomial error distribution and cloglog link function, using BOBYQA optimiser.

Some metrics like observer-level site fidelity, observer-level birding time, birding distance, list duration and list length were either whole number of continuous numerical variables that did not include zero in its possible values. For these, since GLMMs with binomial or Poisson error distributions are not appropriate, we instead fitted LMMs (Linear Mixed Models) with the same fixed and random effects specifications and using BOBYQA optimiser, after first log-transforming (natural) the response variables to ensure normality. The various models of data metrics and their specifications are listed in `table1`. There was no model run for temporal spread due to it being a visual metric and its model specifications being very different from those of other metrics `(S3)`.

diagnostics

We used the `bootMer()` function in the lme4 package in order to test the significance of the fitted model results, by obtaining mean and CI estimates using semi-parametric bootstrapping. The bootstrapping was done with 1000 simulations and with parallel core processing (package parallel).

## Analysis of bird species reporting

To ascertain whether any of the changes in data quantity and quality during the pandemic impacted bird species reporting, or whether reporting changed at all due to any other factor, we conducted two major analyses involving two sets of commonly and easily observed bird species, one set of species common in human-dominated (urban) areas and the other uncommon in urban areas. Since not all species are widespread and equally abundant in different parts of the country, there were a few replacements in the species sets for different regions. Overall, we considered `xx` species in this study, of which `yy` were classified as "urban" and `zz` as "rural". Details of the region-wise species sets are provided in `table2`.

### Overall reporting patterns

In each of the four states analysed in our study, we also selected one of their large metropolitan (urban) cities. For every species in the corresponding regional species set, we visualised individual species reporting patterns at two temporal (months, migratory years) and spatial (city, state) scales. (Analysing species reporting patterns at the national level is not appropriate, considering the large variation in species ranges and abundances.) This was done by calculating the reporting frequency (proportion of qualifying checklists in which a species was reported) of each species at each scale.

We then pooled data from all urban and all rural species, and analysed whether overall species reporting patterns at the large scale (migratory years & state) were affected by the pandemic. This gave us an idea of how urban and rural species idiosyncratically differed in terms of general reporting, how species reporting varied across urban areas and how this averaged out over a large spatial scale, and how species reporting varied over the course of a year and how this variation was expressed at the large temporal scale. Kamrup Metropolitan, the metropolitan capital of the state of Assam, did not have sufficient data for visualisation of month-level patterns, so this combination was dropped.

`table2`

### Reporting patterns with consistent effort

The quality of citizen science data is contingent on observer effort; it is possible for changes in observer effort to produce artefactual changes in metrics such as reporting frequency. Given the existence of biases in effort driven by birder behaviour, it then becomes difficult to make inferences from such data. Hence, in order to ensure that the patterns visible in overall bird species reporting at the large scale are not driven by changes in data quantity and quality, we conducted a similar analysis using data only from "prolific" birders having consistent effort. An eBirder was considered "prolific" if they had submitted, from a single location, at least 800 qualifying checklists over the course of the four years being analysed (sufficient effort), as well as a minimum of 15 qualifying checklists per month in at least ten months of a year in all four years of the study (consistent effort)\-\--thus translating to about 200 qualifying checklists per year. Since the observer remains constant, and the observer is sufficiently experienced (as inferred from their prolificacy), we assume that detectability of birds in the location also remains similar over the years. Therefore, this analysis allows us to make a reasonable conclusion regarding actual behavioural changes in birds.

From the set of species analysed in the previous section, we determined those to be analysed for each prolific birder by first filtering out uncommon species, retaining only those with an overall reporting frequency (over the entire study period) of at least 15%. Next, from the set of species that passed the first filter, we removed those that appeared in only one location (i.e., was observed by only one prolific birder), since a factor with only one level cannot be used as a random effect in a GLMM. Finally, if any prolific birder (their location) was left with species falling in less than two species categories (i.e., urban and rural) after the filters, they were excluded from the analysis.

### Statistical validation

Like with the metrics of data quantity and quality, the bird reporting patterns were first explored using visualisations, then emerging patterns were validated using simple bootstrapping for confidence estimates as in `S1`, except that the bootstrapped values were calculated separately for each spatial scale and propagation was done from the fine temporal scale of month to the scale of migratory year. Eventually, once the specifics of the analyses were finalised, the patterns were statistically tested using GLMMs. Due to strikingly obvious differences in birding conditions between the lockdown and non-lockdown periods (and due to large differences in results from both approaches), we ran three separate models: one for the months of April and May ("lockdown", `ref`), one for the other ten months ("non-lockdown"), and one for all twelve months together ("all"). This also helps determine whether the effects of the pandemic on species reporting were restricted to the strict lockdown period.

For each of these three time periods, overall bird reporting models were run for each species with grid cell ID as the random effect, while models for reporting patterns with consistent effort were run for each highly birded location with species identity as the random effect. The full model specifications are provided in `table3`. All GLMMs were fit with binomial error distribution and cloglog link function, using BOBYQA optimiser, except in a few `(how many?)` of the overall bird reporting models in which the state-species combination could not be modelled successfully due to either step-halving or convergence issues. In such cases, the canonical link function (logit) was used instead.

diagnostics same as birder

Mean and CI estimates were obtained for the fitted models in the same way as in `Section validation 1`, but with 500 simulations instead of 1000, due to computational limitations.

## Changes to data

Most changes to data quantity and quality were restricted to a few months around the major lockdowns. The only noticeable long-lasting effects of the pandemic were in group birding per observer, hotspot birding and birding protocol, which were all restricted to the lockdown months in 2020 but in 2021 decreased across a large part of the year `(fig)`. Moreover, birding distance `(fig S)` at the national level showed a consistent decrease after MY 2018, including in MY 2021 after the pandemic.

`fig: group birding per observer, hotspot birding, birding protocol`

All other metrics of birder behaviour, spatial coverage, spatial spread and urban bias changed for a few months but remained unaffected at the large temporal scale of year. `(refer to YEAR coefficients in a couple of the model summaries in the supplementary, showing that there were no long-lasting effects)` Moreover, there was no observable decline at all in overall birding effort in terms of time spent birding by an average observer `(model)` or overall area covered by birders `(model)`. In fact, there are even suggestions of a slight increase in these metrics over the years `(graphs)`. Importantly, there was no spatial clustering or concentration of the fine-scale changes to overall birding effort `(graphs of spatial spread; one each of no. lists, prop. lists, grid coverage with threshold)`.

### Consistency across spatial units

The long-term declines in group birding per observer, hotspot birding and birding with travelling protocol were only present at the national level. At the level of individual states, these patterns were highly variable `(fig S)`.

`(fig S: group birding per observer state-level)`.

### Consistency across pandemic years

### What happened during the peak pandemic months?

There were unsurprising changes to several metrics during the peak pandemic months. Group birding per observer decreased considerably `(refer)`, while site fidelity per observer increased `(refer)`. Birding in general became shorter in terms of distance covered, birding duration and list length `(refer)`. Proportions of hotspot birding and travelling protocol lists decreased, whereas urban birding proportion increased. Spatial coverage?

## Changes in bird reporting patterns

Bird reporting patterns were explored for \_\_ species (urban, rural) at the national level, and \_\_ (), \_\_ (), \_\_ () and \_\_ () species for the states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Assam respectively. While urban species are reported slightly more frequently than rural species in general, the pandemic months in 2020 saw an even further increase in urban species reporting, but this was restricted to the state of Karnataka `(2 months graph of all states)`. Notably, this did not translate across the entire pandemic years `(12 months graph of all states)`.

`fig: 2 months of all states overall models`

Bird reporting with consistent effort during the pandemic months increased for both urban and non-urban species `(2 months panel)`, while there was no change at all during the other months of the year `(10 months panel)`. The resulting pattern of bird reporting at the large temporal scale of year does not have any noticeable urban bias `(12 months panel)`. Moreover, the reporting patterns during the pandemic months were highly variable and often contradictory across the different locations in the country `(2 months panel)`.

# Discussion

## Changes to data

We expected some changes to eBird data from the pandemic due to behavioural changes in the birding community caused directly by the various restrictions as well as lifestyle changes brought by the pandemic. Interestingly, our results suggest that official restrictions introduced during the peak periods of the pandemic (like the various lockdown periods) were more instrumental in changing birder behaviour, while changes in lifestyle were not drastic or long-lasting enough to affect birder behaviour in the long run.

Indeed, we found that while overall birding effort did not decrease during the pandemic (S number of lists, S number of active/new eBirders, observer-level birding time), birders switched their behaviours in certain expected ways during the peak lockdown periods in India. The most obvious and direct change was due to the various restrictions on movement, travel and social interaction: birders avoided interacting with other birders (group birding per observer), and became more sedentary by limiting travel (observer-level site fidelity) and staying put (birding protocol, hotspots). Checklist-level effort decreased during lockdown, with lists becoming shorter overall (list length, S distance, S duration), but this must not be confused with overall birding effort which did not decrease.

These changes in birder behaviour imply different things for eBird data quality. Since a large majority of the eBirding community is urban, birders becoming more sedentary also meant a clear bias towards urban areas in the data generated during the lockdown. This urban bias was much more prominent during the first lockdown than the second, despite the latter year having been more devastating in terms of COVID-19 cases. This suggests that the novelty of the disease during the first year played an important role. The lower mobility of birders also meant a slight decline in overall spatial coverage of the data during the lockdown (spatial coverage), although the magnitude of this change was not as high as that of some of the other changes. This trend also varied depending on the area (state-level) and scale under consideration. Our results also suggest once again that outside of the peak lockdown months, as soon as restrictions were lifted, birders reverted to their "normal" state of birding behaviours.

Despite the presence of these fine-scale changes in overall birding and checklist-level effort, these were not concentrated in any notable way in space, i.e., major changes were not located all in certain parts of the country (spatial spread) `nor strictly in the pandemic months`. This means that while there did exist variations in metrics of effort, these were spread throughout the country, were not necessarily due to the pandemic, and were also often contradictory trends that cancelled out at the large scale.

## Changes in bird reporting patterns

Given such changes to the data, we wanted to know whether there were complementary (artefactual) changes in bird species reporting patterns. Another possibility was that bird reporting patterns changed as a consequence of true changes in bird abundance or behaviour during the pandemic, which would suggest that birds are able to respond and adapt quickly to changes in the environment.

## Comparison to results from elsewhere

Birds are a great study group for these questions, as they have been researched extensively and are also easier to observe than others. Additionally, their responses are expected to be highly insightful, as they are closely linked to human activity: not only do anthropogenic factors affect habitat availability, suitability, survival and fitness, etc., but many of their behavioural traits are also directly affected by human activity (e.g., song amplitude and frequency, time of vocal activity, etc.). Indeed, during the period of most stringent restrictions in USA, although a few species showed a decline, most increased in abundance in areas that saw a decrease in human activity [@schrimpf2021]. In contrast, species tightly linked to human presence and activity like the Feral Pigeon showed lower abundances [@soh2021].

There is also recent proof that behavioural traits can change rapidly in response to new changes in environmental conditions: @derryberry2020 showed that as traffic noise levels in urban areas during the lockdown decreased significantly, birds quickly adapted and optimised their vocalisation by producing higher performance songs at lower amplitudes, maximising communication distance and salience. Elsewhere, @gordo2021 disentangled probability of occurrence from detectability of birds, and found that the latter increased in urban areas throughout the day, especially during the early hours, evidencing phenotypic plasticity. Notably however, they also found that in urban areas the lockdown did not result in higher occurrence rates of birds than before. In the few cases of marginal increases, the authors attribute this instead to more intensive and homogenous urban sampling during the lockdown (whereas prior to the pandemic urban sampling would have included urban parks or suburbs).

## Implications of pandemic-induced changes for eBird data

If the changes in eBird data did lead to artefactual changes in bird species reporting patterns, this would have consequences for the usefulness of eBird data from the pandemic. In all other cases, given that overall birding effort has only been increasing, eBird data would remain valuable.

Bird reporting patterns were much less consistent and unanimous at the small scale. There was high and often contradictory variability in patterns of change across the different parts of the country as well as across different bird species. This meant that there was no notable and clearly directional change in bird reporting during the pandemic, at larger spatial and temporal scales.

### Importance of scale

Our results highlight the importance of scale, both spatial and temporal, in considering the effects of a major event like the COVID-19 pandemic. At the small scale of states (or even smaller like districts) and months, there were clear and expected changes in birder behaviour and, consequently, to data quality. Most of the changes to data quality reverted to "normal" levels after the lockdown months, hence resulting in very few notable changes at the larger temporal scale of years. This scale is more relevant to most analyses using eBird data.

The bird reporting patterns highlight the importance of scale.

### Guidelines for using pandemic eBird data from India

Thus, we can conclude that eBird data from India from the pandemic years is still a valuable asset. When formulating a question to be answered using this data, the researcher must first consider the scale (spatial and temporal) of the question. Questions of larger scale can be tackled directly, whereas small-scale questions might benefit from a deep-dive into patterns in the raw data that can potentially create misleading patterns. In the latter cases, the researcher is recommended to conduct similar analyses to the ones in this study in order to first assess the suitability of the data before attempting to answer the question. However, there is still tremendous potential for citizen science data like eBird in exploring large-scale patterns.
