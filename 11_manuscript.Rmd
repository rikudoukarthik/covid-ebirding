# Introduction

Like the bubonic plague, influenza, smallpox and even cholera, COVID-19 is a deadly infectious disease that has resulted in a widespread pandemic. It is the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century and one of the deadliest in human history, with a death toll of more than 5.5 million (around 0.07% of the global population) (@zotero-837; @wikipedia2022). Unsurprisingly, governments across the world have taken various precautionary measures and have implemented various restrictions such as nation- or state-wide lockdowns and curfews, quarantines and self-isolation, and shutting down of non-essential public services and activities. In such unprecedented and disruptive times, the shortcomings of traditional methods of data collection for scientific research---which are especially contingent on human circumstances---become strikingly obvious and hamper progress. However, many of these do not apply as strongly to (and hence can be overcome by using) large-scale, crowdsourced, open access data on a wide variety of metrics, from human traffic levels to species occurrence (@bates2020). Citizen science today is a research technique that engages volunteers from the general public---most of whom are not trained as scientists---in collecting and/or analysing and interpreting data as part of a scientific enquiry (@silvertown2009). Citizen science studies usually follow more relaxed sampling designs than traditional systematic counterparts (see @pocock2017), lowering the barrier for participation. Although this leads to more noise in the generated data, the bigger size of the datasets generally compensates for this. More importantly, citizen science programmes facilitate attempts at answering large-scale questions that are otherwise not feasible (@macphail2020).

The direct distress of the pandemic, together with the various preventive measures implemented to control it, has had severe impacts on general health and well-being of the public, affecting not just physical but also psychological and social facets. Thus, the pandemic has also required people to actively monitor and improve their health. Leisure and recreation activities play a vital role in improving physical and mental health, and moreover, outdoor activities are better for restoring attention than indoor ones (@weng2014). Birdwatching (hereafter birding) is a nature-based recreation activity that is enjoyed by people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Birders frequently make "checklists" of the bird species they observe in different birding sessions, often with accurate counts. By volunteering the data that is thus inherently collected during participation in the activity, numerous birders---from trained researchers to experienced birders to laypersons---are able to contribute to the scientific study of birds. eBird (@sullivan2014) is a citizen science project that gathers and stores data from birders all over the world, enabling large-scale robust scientific analysis and output (@kelling2019). eBird data has proved very useful in better understanding the ecology of birds, species ranges (e.g., @sreekumar2021; @sinnott2021), migration (e.g., @aoki2021; @youngflesh2021), behaviour (e.g., @alaniz2020; @winger2019), morphology (e.g., **Menon et al. 2022**; @vrettos2021) and conservation action (@sullivan2017; @soib2020; @ruiz-gutierrez2021). (See **Patankar et al. 2022 in press** for list of scientific output using eBird from India.) The data from citizen science projects such as eBird thus become all the more important in times like the current pandemic, when many traditional research programmes are brought to a halt.

An interesting avenue for biological research that has recently opened up is the influence of anthropogenic factors on different organisms. However, these questions usually prove difficult to answer because of the difficulty in, even hypothetically, nullifying the human footprint. Considering the arrival of the pandemic amidst this latest period of intense and extremely rapid expansion of human activity (and thereby modification of the environment), it offers an invaluable opportunity to study exactly these questions, in ways not possible otherwise. In particular, the strict lockdowns enforced in order to control the pandemic are periods of greatly reduced human activity and allow us to study ecological release in the context of human pressure, and to identify organisms that are most affected and vulnerable to these stresses (@rutz2020; see also @bates2020).

Birds are a great study group for this purpose, as they have been researched extensively and are also easier to observe than others. Additionally, their responses are expected to be highly insightful, as they are closely linked to human activity: not only do anthropogenic factors affect habitat availability, suitability, survival and fitness, etc., but many of their behavioural traits are also directly affected by human activity (e.g., song amplitude and frequency, time of vocal activity, etc.). Indeed, during the period of most stringent restrictions in USA, although a few species showed a decline in abundance, most increased in abundance in areas that saw a decrease in human activity (@schrimpf2021). In contrast, species tightly linked to human presence and activity like the Feral Pigeon showed lower abundances (@soh2021). There is also recent proof that behavioural traits can change rapidly in response to new changes in environmental conditions: @derryberry2020 showed that as traffic noise levels in urban areas during the lockdown decreased significantly, going down to mid-1950s levels, birds optimised their breeding behaviour by producing higher performance songs at lower amplitudes, maximising communication distance and salience. 

Elsewhere, @gordo2021 disentangled the effect of probability of occurrence from that of detectability of birds, and found that the latter increased in urban areas throughout the day, especially during the early hours, evidencing phenotypic plasticity. Notably however, they also found that in urban areas the lockdown did not result in higher occurrence rates of birds than before. In the few cases of marginal increases, since these are species mostly restricted to urban areas and hence do not have sufficiently large non-urban source populations to colonise cities, the authors attribute this increase instead to more intensive and homogenous urban sampling during the lockdown (whereas prior to the pandemic urban sampling would have included urban parks or suburbs). Although the openness, accessibility, size and scale of such citizen science datasets often compromise for the bureaucratic, logistical and practical challenges of traditional data collection protocols, one of its shortcomings is its fundamental unsystematic nature. As the observers decide when, where and for how long to make observations, the sampling processes are bound to vary temporally as well as spatially. And while these less structured projects have not ceased activity during the pandemic, the characteristics of the data collected are likely to have changed substantially due to the various restrictions imposed.

First of all, the quantity of data collected itself could have decreased, owing to various physical and travel restrictions (e.g., @kishimoto2021). On the other hand, there was an increased desire in people to connect with the natural world (e.g., @marsh2021), and even active promotion and encouragement of nature-related activities such as birding (e.g., @birdcountindia2020), which could have generated more data. This has been found to be the case with the citizen science programme iNaturalist (@basile2021). The spatial coverage and evenness of the data could have decreased due to restricted mobility, with observations being clustered in urbanised locations (@vardi2021), thus reducing its overall informational value (@zhang2020). But conversely, the pandemic restrictions could have reduced the tendency for birders to "flock" to birding hotspots (irrespective of the urban-rural dichotomy), and instead forced them to upload observations from around their otherwise less-surveyed neighbourhoods, resulting in less clustering (@kishimoto2021)! The overall diversity of habitats surveyed is likely to have decreased though, as is the proportion of observations using travelling protocols. Moreover, the temporal distribution of observations during the pandemic could also be different from that of prior years. 

Indeed, @randler2020 found that the pandemic-induced lockdown caused significant changes in spatial, temporal, social, demographic and country-related aspects of birding. On the other hand, @hochachka2021 found that alteration in birder behaviour during a month-long lockdown, while present, was not as substantial as expected from the magnitude of change to daily life, and that biases were seen mostly in habitat representation and observer effort. The four political units they studied all showed different patterns, emphasising the need to consider regional differences. Moreover, the study was concerned only with a single month, so how exactly these results will translate to patterns at the broader temporal scale is unanswered. Most studies looking at large-scale temporal trends would compare multiple years and possibly regions. Hence, when using the data from the pandemic together with "normal" data, it becomes imperative to ascertain exactly how the data characteristics would have been affected by the pandemic and also how this would influence the inferences that can be made, and to then account for these appropriately.

The present study focuses on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on birds, the birding community and eBird data in the Indian context, trying to understand the consequences of these changes on citizen science and the inferences that can be drawn from it. Lastly, it will propose guidelines for making the most of the available data while accounting for pandemic-driven biases and deviations from pre-COVID normals. 

# Methods

To ensure a balanced time frame, this study will focus on the years from 2018 to 2021. The time period of 2018–19 will be considered as “pre-COVID” while 2020–21 will be considered “COVID”. In order to account for within-year variations in bird and birder behaviour, the comparisons will be made on the month level. For instance, various metrics of birding behaviour in the month of June will be compared between 2018–19 and 2020–21, and will not be confounded with patterns seen in other months. 

year-to-year variability not possible
